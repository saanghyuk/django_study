  "contents": "The 2020 calendar year will long be remembered as an annus horribilis for most, except for a handful of technology companies who reaped the rewards of a global shift to remote work with \u00a0successful initial public offerings (IPOs).US companies alone raised a record $435 billion in stock sales in 2020, with more than a quarter of that figure coming from IPOs \u2014 far outstripping 2014's mark of $279 billion, according to data compiled by . The vast majority of those new listings defined themselves as technology companies.Cloud-based software firms like Zoom, Snowflake, Asana, Airbnb and Palantir all , and continue to see their stock price flourish as remote work and e-commerce continue to be the norm for many into 2021.The question now is whether this trend will continue through the year. There are a host of companies eying an early debut in 2021 to take advantage of favorable conditions. But, as with all market debuts, timing will be everything, with a number of industry analysts   of a .Here are the biggest technology IPOs of the year so far.DigitalOcean had a disappointing \u00a0on March 24, with its stock sinking 9.6% on its first day. The New York-based cloud firm initially priced its IPO at $47, which was on the top end of the expected range of $44 to $47. It closed its first day at $42.50 a share, valuing the company at $4.5 billion.DigitalOcean promises a simple platform for software developers to quickly spin up and host applications in the cloud on virtual private servers (VPS); it competes with the big cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and other Platform as a Service providers such as Heroku, a Salesforce company, and VPS vendors like Linode.Like many tech companies at IPO, DigitalOcean is not profitable, having registered a net loss of $44 million on revenue of $318 million in 2020.Reviews website  floated on the London Stock Exchange on March 23, where its stock surged by as much as 11% on debut, hitting \u00a32.95 a share, up from its offer price of \u00a32.65 ($3.65). That puts the company value at \u00a31.1 billion.The Danish firm collates independent reviews for online businesses and counted as many as 120 million reviews by the end of 2020, for everything from utilities providers to yoga studios. It makes money by selling subscriptions to businesses who want to engage with consumer reviews in their marketing campaigns. Its revenue was up 25% in 2020, reaching $102 million at a loss of $12.2 million.Food-ordering software maker Olo raised $450 million in an initial public offering on March 17.\u00a0The New York-based SaaS company sold 18 million shares at $25 each, above its pre-IPO range of $20 to $22, valuing the company at $3.55 billion.Olo software powers loyalty programs and allows restaurants to manage orders and menus and currently counts a range of US-based customers including Five Guys, California Pizza Kitchen, and The Cheesecake Factory.Utah-based software company Qualtrics went public on Jan. 28, just two years after its $8 billion  on the eve of its first planned IPO in 2018.Qualtrics initially priced its IPO at $30 per share, which was the top end of its expected range, before popping a massive 52% on its Nasdaq debut. It closed at $45.50 a share, valuing the firm at $27.3 billion.Founded by brothers Ryan and Jared Smith alongside their father and fourth co-founder Stuart Orgill, \u00a0before growing into a platform for large companies like Disney,  and  to collect a variety of \"experience data\" from employees and customers.Qualtrics fared pretty well as part of the SAP family, growing revenue 30% in the first three quarters of 2020 to $550 million. It did continue to operate at a loss of $244 million however, with $218 million of stock-based compensation skewing that number pretty dramatically.SAP will maintain majority ownership of the vendor post-IPO, and private equity firm Silver Lake now owns a little over 4% of the stock. Ryan Smith has somewhat stepped away from the day-to-day running of Qualtrics since  last year.Other companies rumored to be lining up a 2021 IPO include Instacart, ZipRecruiter, Coursera, Bumble, Squarespace, and Coinbase."

  "contents": "Microsoft's decision in February to strip an identifier used for decades from some Windows update release notes continues to draw the ire of customers.On Feb. 18, the company announced on its Windows IT Pro blog that it would no longer include the KB identifier \u2014  for Knowledge Base \u2014 in the URLs of all online release notes associated with Windows update release details. The KB identifiers have been used by Microsoft for several decades to pinpoint individual bug fixes and guide customers to the appropriate documentation.\"One of the primary ways that many find release notes is through the use of a KB identifier (KBID),\" Christine Ahonen, a program manager at Microsoft, wrote in the . \"We use a unique identifier for each Windows update. Once a KBID is created, it is then used to identify the update throughout the release process, including documentation.\"Ahonen noted that the KB identifier was used in not only the title of the release note but more importantly, in URL of that note, in the format .But such wouldn't be the standard in the future.\"For instance, the URL structure of  is still supported, however, it will redirect to a newly formatted URL ,\" Ahonen said. (, aka  is a Microsoft-specific 128-bit integer \u2014 consisting of 8 hexadecimal digits, followed by three groups of 4 hexadecimal digits each, followed by one group of 12 hexadecimal digits \u2014 used to identify, in this case, a specific release note.) \"Additionally, if a KBID appears in the title of a page, it will appear in the URL. If a KBID is not in the title, it will not appear in the URL. Types of articles where you may not find a KBID include informational articles and articles released for non-cumulative updates or specialty packages.\"Ahonen did not initially divulge the reason for the change.Users reacted immediately to the announcement. And none applauded it.\"Why can't you just add it (the KD identifier) to the URL?\" asked  in a comment. \"You've got a title and a huge GUID there already. KBID isn't an overhead. But no, you make us view or parse the source. Your approach doesn't make sense, but you don't really bother to explain it.\"\"Hold the phone. Enough. Don't mess with my KB numbers,\" wrote  in another comment. (Bradley, who publishes the Windows tip newsletter , also contributes to Computerworld as .) This is how we all 'speak' in terms of patches, patch management, etc.\"Clearly this is making it easier  but not . You remember us? Your customers? The ones you should be making happy? If it is a KB, then it needs to have a . Period.\"Others echoed Sterkin and Bradley. \"When tackling updates, it's very common for me to just type  into the address bar,\" said someone identified as . \"This is a terrible change, and I fail to see the benefit of it in any way.\"On March 4, Ahonen returned to the then-dormant comment section of her post from weeks before with news about the decision to drop the KB identifier.\"This is the result of our change over to a new Content Management System (CMS),\" . \"This new CMS does not support the old URL patterns and so we needed to adapt to the new structure.\"To have this function like the old system, we have added redirectors to use both older patterns:\"Typing either one of these old patterns will take you to the new URL,\" Ahonen continued. \"You can still link to the old URL patterns and it will take you or your customers to the correct location.\"Ahonen also said that  Windows servicing update article would have the appropriate KB identifier in its title, including all security updates as well as all non-security updates. \"These articles will be fully searchable,\" she said.The automatic-redirection, however, didn't solve the problem caused by Microsoft scrubbing the KB identifier from some URLs, Bradley argued. \"Could you determine the KB number easily from that page?\" she asked, referring to the URL of a release note for a problem she had encountered. \"I can't visually see that KB number ... easily anymore. None of these changes make our jobs easier.\"Ahonen commiserated with Bradley in a .\"I agree that it is frustrating not to be able to find the KBID on the page or in the URL for some of these outlying articles,\" she said. \"We are looking at various solutions to work around the limitation.\" Ahonen also urged users to continue providing feedback. \"The more we understand the way that customers use these IDs the better our resolution will be.\"She gave no hint, however, that the removal of KB identifiers would be reversed \u2014 not surprising considering it's connected to the new CMS platform, a serious investment in any instance.Bradley countered with a final example. \"This was an update widely pushed to our machines, it wasn't an outlying article,\" Bradley wrote in a , offering the support document's title and one-line description, neither of which included a KB identifier. \"If something is going to be pushed through the Windows Update channel, it needs a KB front and center.\""

Another 45% are investing in contactless technologies such as biometrics and voice user interfaces and 17% are replacing on-premises PBX with cloud-based telephony.Paul Gentile, senior director of product marketing at LogMeIn, said IT decision makers need to think about ways to optimize the software they use to ensure that hybrid work is,\u00a0\u201c[successful] for employees that need support and for customers that they're going to interact and engage with them in a different way.They also need to tie in security measures, because as IT decision makers that report into a CTO or CIO, there\u2019s always going to be concern about how much vulnerability they have at stake,\" Gentile ssid. \"The idea that remote work is really related to and only focuses on video conferencing or video meetings is a fallacy.\"The updated  offers users a new mobile UI designed to make employees more productive by, for example, allowing them to receive and make work calls on a mobile device without using their personal number. It also offers\u00a0features such as Find Me and Follow Me, Advance Call Flip, Shared Extension, and Voicemail Transcriptions.LogMeIn is also looking to bolster productivity in cloud-based contact centers, which have proved crucial to some companies' ability to maintain business continuity.\u201cThose cloud deployments are going to be more critical than ever before when customers start to think about optimizing their tech stack,\u201d said Gentile. \u201cIt\u2019s not just with UCC, but with our remote support and management solutions, with our security identity and access management solution with LastPass password protection. We\u2019ve created one single SKU, one delivery mechanism for all of these pieces brought together under one roof.\"Native integrations have also been made with Microsoft Teams to simplify and improve workflow. These allow users to continue to use Microsoft Teams with GoToConnect, powering their telephony service on the back end with direct routing capabilities. It also supports features such as click-to-call and user presence without having to switch out of the Teams app.Castanon said the updates announced this week should be welcome news for LogMeIn customers\u00a0\u201cFeatures such as an enhanced mobility experience and voicemail transcriptions, as well as enhanced admin and support capabilities, should allow the company to better address the requirements of the hybrid/remote workforce,\u201d he said.According to Gentile, conversations with customers and analysts over the past year found that most customers are looking to simplify their tech offerings, with buyers turning to one vendor/one platform options or best-of-breed offerings \u2014 all of them underpinned by cloud technology.\u201cSome employers went rogue in the way that they went about using different remote tools [at the start of the pandemic]. Now, 2021 is about them trying to consolidate, getting their arms back around this [issue] and doing so, while still maintaining the idea that you can be anywhere you want, and still be productive,\u201d he said.In a post-pandemic world, Gentile said work tools need to be flexible, cloud-based, secure, and easy to buy, deploy, and use.\u00a0\u201c...Simplicity is paramount as far as them being able to make ... sure that they're saving dollars,\" he said. varies, depending on what level of service a company wants and how many employees it has. Costs range from $22 to $39 per user per month.Castanon said remote work will continue to be an option for many workers for the forseeable future.\u201cThis is an intensely competitive space; however, it\u2019s fair to say that LogMeIn has a leg up with products such as LastPass and GoToAssist which were designed for these use cases,\" he said. \"Bringing them together to enhance GoToConnect could allow the company to position itself as a UCC platform for hybrid/remote workforce and differentiate from its competition.\""

  "title": "This year's biggest Android upgrade disappointment",
  "img_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/android-upgrade-disappointment-100880234-large.jpg",
  "contents": "To say this year's Android upgrade performance has been a letdown would be one heck of an understatement.Sure, you could point out the  showing that Android 11's adoption is the best of any recent  in terms of how many phones are running the software as of this six-month mark. And sure, that's certainly .But you know what? That's a pretty frickin' low bar to set. When we're talking about a major new Android release \u2014 software that's filled with important  that affect how both Android itself and third-party apps are allowed to interact with your data \u2014 merely having a fifth of all Android phones running the thing  after its release isn't exactly a win worth celebrating.My data-driven  says it all. Using the same standard formula I've relied on to grade Android device-makers for nearly a decade now (related: I am 700 years old), I found that outside of Google, every major U.S. flagship phone-maker did enough to earn only a D-level or flat-out failing grade with its Android 11 upgrade deliveries. The  score in this year's ranking was a measly 68% D+. And things only get worse from there.Even so, what's listed in that latest Report Card isn't the biggest disappointment of all. Yes, everyone outside of Google can and do better at getting current software out to their highest-paying customers in a reasonably timely manner \u2014 but quite frankly, at this point, most of those letdowns are .The biggest disappointment is actually something that's just a tiny asterisk in the sea of Android \u2014 something not even significant enough to earn a place in that Upgrade Report Card analysis. But it's something that had represented a tiny glimmer of promise in the bigger Android picture and something I had would be a shining highlight of this conversation.I'm talking about the way Microsoft \u2014 yes, Microsoft! \u2014 is handling software support on its first and thus-far-only self-made Android product, the pricey and unusual .The Surface Duo?! Who cares \u2014 right? Believe me, I get it. Microsoft's inaugural Android hardware effort hasn't exactly been a home run or a phone that's made anything more than a pebble-sized splash in the greater Android ocean. But as I've said , the story of the Duo is less about the admittedly imperfect specifics of this single initial product and more about the broader view of what it could show us about Microsoft's mobile ambitions \u2014 what it could , in other words, with future generations of devices.And part of what I was really hoping to see revealed \u2014 something I called the , in fact \u2014 was whether Microsoft could manage to shake up the sad state of Android upgrades.It's not such a crazy notion to consider. Think about it: Outside of Google, most other Android device-makers have absolutely no motivation to make timely and ongoing post-sales software support a priority \u2014 so really, it's no surprise that we see the sorts of halfhearted, tortoise-paced efforts that we do with Android upgrade delivery. Companies like Samsung and Motorola make their money mostly by hawking hardware. Software updates require time and resources, and the companies doing all that legwork don't get anything tangible back in return. If anything, frequent updates actually work  most phone-makers' interests, as they make you less likely to feel the need to go out and buy a shiny new device.Traditionally within Android, Google has been the sole exception to that rule \u2014 since Google's motivated to keep you using your phone (and thus the internet and its services) as much as possible and with as pleasant of an experience as it can muster up. Even if you don't buy new phones all that often, after all, Google still benefits from having you online, engaged, and ecstatic about your Android setup.Microsoft, interestingly enough, is fairly similar. Just like with Google, hardware sales aren't the primary focus of that company's business. Instead, it relies mostly on  to make its money. The hardware is mostly just a way to bring you further into the Microsoft ecosystem \u2014 an ecosystem Microsoft has worked painstakingly to .To quote  of the most handsome and humble writer I know:The Surface Duo, despite its relative insignificance within the Android landscape and within my Report Card at this point, was the first test of how Microsoft might fare in that department. And what's happened?Well, I'll tell ya, Tito: nada. Precisely bupkis. Microsoft hasn't done a damn thing to show any signs of taking operating system upgrades seriously on its first Android device. Six months past the launch of Android 11, the Duo is sitting on increasingly stale, now 18-months-old and out-of-date software. For a company that makes a point of updating its own Windows operating system every seven to 14 seconds \u2014 and a company that most certainly knows the value of maintaining current, optimally up-to-date software, particularly when it comes to business situations \u2014 that's not only disappointing; it's pathetic.Worse yet, Microsoft hasn't made a peep, officially, about what's going on and if and when the Duo  see Android 11. Unofficially,  the phone could get the update \u2014 which, mind you, was released in early September of 2020 \u2014 sometime \"this summer.\"Depending on when exactly that ends up happening, that'd make the upgrade anywhere from nine to a whopping 12 months late. By August or September (both which are still part of summer), we'll be well on our way to seeing the  Android version, , out in the wild. And Microsoft's self-made product might just be getting the previous, already on-the-brink-of-being-outdated release.That'd be unacceptable for Android phone \u2014 even an inexpensive one. For a phone that folks forked out $1,400 for, it's bordering on insulting. And for a phone that comes from a company with Microsoft's history, capabilities, business focus, and experience delivering timely and reliable software updates, it's almost embarrassingly pitiful.I'd like to think Microsoft could still redeem itself and turn things around with future Duo generations, but Goog almighty, it's got an awful lot of improving to accomplish. I don't know that any other company in this arena has come in with so much promise and then fallen so quickly to such a staggering level of disappointment.So come on, Microsoft: Try to exert at least a teensy bit of effort with this, would ya? Even your old pal Clippy's gotta be hangin' his pretty little paperclip head in shame right now."

  "contents": "Microsoft, as expected, has synchronized the release schedule of its Edge browser with Chrome's, which Google had earlier announced would accelerate to an every-four-week cadence.\"As contributors to the Chromium project, we look forward to the new 4-week major release cycle cadence that Google announced, to help deliver that innovation to our customers even faster,\" the Edge team wrote in an unsigned .The week prior,  to match that of Mozilla's Firefox by reducing the current six-to-eight-week schedule to just four weeks. The change won't happen overnight, but instead will take place in the fall, when the span between versions 94 and 95 will fall to four weeks.Chrome 94 is set to release Sept. 21; Chrome 95 is to launch Oct. 19. Microsoft will hew to the same schedule. \"This change in release cycles is expected to start with Edge 94,\" Microsoft said, while pointing to a fleshed-out .(Microsoft has gotten into the habit of releasing the same-numbered Edge two days after the comparable Chrome upgrade. Because Google issues updates on Tuesdays, that means Microsoft does on Thursdays. The likely release date for Edge 94, then, will be Sept. 23, and that of Edge 95, Oct. 21.)Because Microsoft has hitched Edge to Chromium's wagon \u2014 the open-source project is responsible for building and maintaining the core technologies for Chrome, and since January 2020, Edge \u2014 the Redmond, Wash. company had little choice but to go along with the change to release timing. The only alternative would have been to delay Edge releases, obviously unacceptable.Although Chromium's work is used by numerous browsers \u2014 Brave and Opera, for example, as well as Edge \u2014 Google calls most of the shots; not only did Google start Chromium, but its engineers continue to dominate its work. It's unclear, for instance, what voice, if any, Microsoft (and other makers) had in the release acceleration.Also per Google's plans, Microsoft will offer a less-frequently updated edition of Edge aimed at commercial customers. This \"Extended Stable\" release will upgrade every eight weeks \u2014 thus skipping every other build \u2014 but will be serviced by security updates on a two-week tempo. Extended Stable will only be available to organizations that manage their machines.The eight-week schedule of Chrome and now Edge pales in comparison to that of Firefox, whose Extended Support Release, or ESR, forswears feature and functionality changes for more than a year. (ESR receives all security updates normally.)Last week was also a milestone for Edge: on March 9, Microsoft ended support for the original browser by that name.Debuting as part of Windows 10 in mid-2015, the so-called \"legacy\" Edge never caught on. Rather than see it waste away, Microsoft abandoned its own home-ground rendering and scripting technologies and took up Chromium's, first offering the new Edge in a stable form 14 months ago.With the end of support, legacy Edge will be a risk to run, as vulnerabilities will not be patched. Obviously, Microsoft wants its users to adopt the Chromium-fied Edge rather than switch to, say, Chrome or Firefox. To that end, next month's Windows 10 cumulative update \u2014 slated to arrive April 13 \u2014 will ."

  "title": "WFH boom makes \u2018employee experience\u2019 a C-suite priority, says Microsoft Viva chief",
  "img_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/02/viva-insights-100876130-large.jpg",
  "contents": "After a year of dealing with pandemic-related issues, C-suite leaders now find themselves focused on the \u201cemployee experience,\u201d according to Chuck Friedman, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president in charge of the company\u2019s new Viva platform., which the company highlighted at this year\u2019s , is designed to provide digital tools to support remote workers. , it is an employee experience platform (EXP), with four modules focused on employee engagement, well-being, learning, and knowledge.Though interest in employee experience had been on the rise, said Friedman, it took off last year as businesses switched to a largely remote-work model and had to deal with issues such as access to online training and development, maintaining company culture, and even avoiding burnout.As the COVID-19 pandemic shut down offices worldwide, \u201csuddenly we moved from a workplace [where] people could be next to each other to a remote workplace where the demand for these things moved to digital,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cAll of these things starting to come together\u2026,\u201d leading to Viva.As with all areas of digital transformation, the need to  \u2014 everything from HR applications to workforce analytics and employee engagement \u2014 boomed during the pandemic, said Raul Castanon, a senior research analyst at 451 Research, part of\u00a0S&P\u00a0Global Market Intelligence.\u00a0About four out of five businesses (78%) see supporting remote workers as a challenge over the next two years, according to 451, with\u00a0employee experience issues \u2014 such as work-life balance, access to technology, team morale, and employee retention \u2014 among top concerns.As a result, said Friedman, an issue that had largely fallen on human resources has grown in importance among senior business leaders. \u201cThat [responsibility] has fundamentally changed,\u201d he said, \u201cand the entire C-suite is now thinking about the experience of their employees: How do they retain employees, how do they maintain morale of their employees?\u201dPre-pandemic, HR was closely involved with the employee experience, particularly \u00a0employee engagement, while CIOs, IT managers ,and line of business (LOB) leaders focused more on technology adoption and change management, said Castanon.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now post-pandemic is a convergence and a growing overlap that is leading to cooperation between these areas\u2026. HR is increasingly concerned with productivity, IT with employee engagement, LOB managers with both, and so on,\u201d he said.Matt Cain, a Gartner vice president and distinguished analyst, said in a report that Viva is likely to \u201celevate the prominence\u201d of employee experience technology in IT circles, and should lead to increased interest in a variety of services, \u201crequiring greater levels of IT and HR collaboration.\u201dAt Ignite, Microsoft offered up more details about the four Viva modules \u2013 Connections, Insights, Learning and Topics. Among the updates is the introduction of a desktop app for Viva Connections, the company-branded intranet portal that uses SharePoint on Yammer and provides access to news, conversations, and other resources. The desktop app will be available this month, with a mobile version due this summer. The Connections module will be available at no extra cost to existing Microsoft 365 customers.Viva Learning \u2014 which serves up an organization\u2019s custom content along with resources from Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn Learning and third-party providers \u2014 will arrive as a public preview in April. Pricing and subscription details will be released when that module becomes available, said Microsoft.Viva Insights, the analytics module that combines elements of the existing MyAnalytics personal productivity tracker and Workplace Analytics team-wide metrics, is now in public preview. At Ignite, Microsoft touted a \u201cvirtual commute\u201d feature available in preview next month, and an integration with the Headspace guided meditation app arriving later in the year. Insights is available at no extra cost to Microsoft 365 users, with the organization-level insights accessed as an add-on via Workplace Analytics.Microsoft Viva Topics is the only generally available module currently, and costs $5 per user each month.Friedman said early interest in the platform has come from companies of all sizes. While Microsoft has worked closely with large enterprises on Viva, Friedman sees the platform as a good fit for smaller businesses, too.\u201cI think the problem is universal; small- and medium-sized businesses have the same set of challenges and they need the same set of tools,\u201d he said, noting that different businesses will gravitate to various aspects of Viva.\u201cFrontline worker-focused companies are looking at learning and skilling as a real opportunity,\u201d he said, arguing that Viva Connections can keep non-office-based workers in the loop with their wider organization via their mobile device. And information workers can use of Insights to address burnout, for instance. \u00a0A key aspect of Viva is the availability of its modules within Microsoft\u2019s Teams collaboration platform, which has 115 million daily active users. But Friedman acknowledged the danger of overloading users with too much information and too many notifications.Microsoft worked to design a user interface (UI) that minimizes information overload, Friedman said. He pointed to Viva Connections, which can serve as a front-end UI within Teams to highlight .\u201cThe Connections module has the ability to compose all of the Viva capabilities and communicate with a single voice,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm hopeful we can simplify some of the UI inside Teams by using Connections as a sort of front end, a highlighted experience, as opposed to the idea of many different applications trying to reach the employee at the same time.\u201dMachine learning can also help pick the right time for notifications. \u201cWhen you're in the middle of an interview, it's probably not the right time for a learning [notification] to pop up and say, 'Hey, Chuck \u2014 do you want to take some learning right now?'\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to \u2026 use the right moments of the day to [be] proactive in communication.\u201cThe flip side is if you bury things too deeply,\u201d said Friedman. \u201cLearning is another great example. The Learning content exists in many companies today, but when an employee wants to go and learn something new, they often have a hard time finding it.\u201dWith Viva Insights, Microsoft wants the analytics available in Microsoft 365 to be more accessible by employees, managers, and business leaders. for many collaboration and productivity vendors, and Microsoft\u2019s existing MyAnalytics and Workplace Analytics are central within Viva.Microsoft came under fire for another of its analytics tools last year, ; \u00a0it highlighted a worker\u2019s application use to Microsoft 365 admins before changes were announced to anonymize and aggregate data at the individual level.Friedman said maintaining employee privacy is important in Viva. \u201cWe will build clarity into the UI around what data is shown and what data is not. We\u2019re doing many things on the back-end to make sure that we are only showing aggregate data, that we are removing anything that's personally identifiable\u2026.Then we will build reinforcement methods into the UI and transparency around why they can trust the data, who has access to it, that type of experience.\u201dAt the same time, Friedman said there are benefits to both workers and business leaders in analytics data.\u201c\u2026There\u2019s value in transparency around things like goals, things like purpose for the team,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to help managers do an increasingly effective job of communicating to their teams, what their team is focused on, and then show aggregate sentiment through tools like Glint: 'When you made this announcement or when you announced this set of goals for your team, here's what the impact was on the team.'\u201dWith Viva services at various levels of availability and the likelihood of more modules on the way, Microsoft is just getting started \u2014 and analysts see room for expansion. In his report, Cain described Viva\u2019s modules as \u201cstarting investments, rather than fully fledged mature services with clear and tangible business value.\u201dWhile Microsoft calls Viva an employee experience platform, Gartner classifies it as an example of EXTech, \u201ca diverse collection of employee-facing applications designed to influence and improve the employee experience and organizational culture,\u201d said Cain.\u201cA fully realized employee experience platform would have a broader top-level organizational structure, address a much larger set of touchpoints and interactions, and meet the needs of a variety of employee types, including desk-less or frontline workers.\u201dCastanon said Microsoft\u2019s investment in Viva amounts to the most ambitious attempt to provide a unified platform for employee experience so far.\u201cWe expect there will be additional capabilities and modules added,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, as it stands it is probably among the most comprehensive EXP currently available.\u201dUnifying various tools can help businesses adapt to remote work in the long term, he said, and Viva\u2019s comprehensive approach could be \u201cinstrumental for organizations looking to tackle the challenges of the \u2018new normal,\u2019\u201d such as \u201cmanaging employee productivity and engagement for a distributed workforce, and understanding the complexities that enabling secure remote collaboration entails.\u201cThis will require a broader organizational transformation effort; the Viva platform could be instrumental for enabling this transformation,\u201d Castanon said.\u201cWe're at this category-creation moment,\u201d said Friedman. In that sense, he said, Microsoft\u2019s strategy differs from that of Office 365, where well-established products were packaged as a subscription. Although Viva modules rely heavily on existing Microsoft 365 services such as SharePoint, Yammer, and MyAnalytics, the services represent a new focus and new modes of interaction based on the employee experience.\u201cI would say we're early in this journey,\u201d he said. \u201cVery often, when Microsoft engages it's a better-established category. I don't think employee experience platforms as a category are fully defined yet, and that's exciting; you can point in a lot of directions\u2026.\u201cWe expect that this will evolve over time; we're investing intentionally in being a leader in the space.\u201d"

  "contents": "Developers should beware, as cybercriminals have figured out that the best attack vectors to infect the Apple ecosystem may be the developers themselves.We\u2019ve known for a long time that malware makers and other cyber-miscreants are smart.\u00a0The work they do brings in real money, with a healthy trade in corporate and personal secrets, bank account details, fraud, and ransomware generating a market some say is already worth billions \u2014 even as it .You can argue about the economic consequences, but there\u2019s little doubt that the  generated a spike in socially engineered attacks, from fraudulent websites to phishing and beyond. And while the , with the majority of serious incidents stemming from weak user security practises and successful manipulation using traditional attack vectors such as malware-infested emails and website links, the pandemic has also seen .With  deployed in 2020 apparently being Macs, Apple\u2019s platforms are becoming keen targets for criminal enterprise.\u00a0The problem for criminals: Apple\u2019s inherently solid security, along with the capacity to rush security upgrades out to millions of users because of the company\u2019s non-fragmented platforms, makes doing so quite difficult.In response, attackers appear to be returning to the drawing board and now seem to be working to inject attacks early on in the process.\u00a0The way they see it is that if you can\u2019t persuade people to download Apple malware, you need to inject it inside applications users already trust.The latest illustration of this (\u201cXcodeSpy\u201d) has been identified by a team of security .\u00a0They claim to have found an infected code library in the wild that attempts to install malware on Macs used by software developers. It comes as a copy of a legitimate open-source project Xcode users might choose to build animated tab bars.Once installed, this software quietly executes a script that downloads backdoor software that monitors what the developer does via the microphone, camera and keyboard.While this sounds pretty rough, it\u2019s no reason for over-reaction. But it should serve as a warning to Apple developers in all walks of life, (particularly in enterprise IT) to ensure they are completely certain of what third-party tools and open-source packages they use when building applications.notes another recent incident of malware aimed at developers, when what were thought to be state-sponsored hackers engaged in an extensive campaign to win trust from security researchers via social media to convince them to install malware.In a sense, the shape of this particular set of security adventures was set in 2015 when\u00a0, a version of Apple\u2019s developer tool that was given a little extra zing in the form of built-in malware. Apps built using XcodeGhost all shipped with malware installed. While this attack was mostly confined to the APAC region, it  for apps containing code built by XCodeGhost to stop circulating. \u00a0The logic here makes complete sense. Even in Apple\u2019s curated App Store model, iPhone, iPad, and Mac customers have built a big sense of trust in the way they download and install software.Indeed given that Apple continues to add friction to the experience of downloading software from outside its stores, malware makers know that the best way to distribute their wares is via the App Store itself.This must ultimately be the prize they seek \u2014 to build an attack mechanism that silently infects enough developers of legitimate Apple apps so that the apps they then sell via Apple\u2019s store carry malware into devices belonging to millions of users.This hasn\u2019t happened yet, and I think that Apple\u2019s store security, software code checking, and verification tools mean it may never happen at all. But this is certainly part of what Apple\u2019s customers and developers pay for in their App Store distribution fees.What makes this of a little more concern is that this latest alert follows just months after\u00a0, again by targeting developers.The bottom line?Apple\u2019s highly secure platforms are tough to break, but there\u2019s a big profit motive to try to do so.Given that the weakest link in any security chain is now and always has been the user, no surprise then that those with a nose for this kind of security subversion are spending time figuring out how to trick developers into unwittingly becoming their own secret attack vectors.I think this means developers in the Apple ecosystem will need to security audit their software code repositories a little more often in future. Because you have been identified as potentially being the weakest link in the security chain.It would also be a good time to review\u00a0\u00a0and this (older, but still useful)\u00a0."

However, a month ago, the Redmond, Wash. developer implied that, unlike in years past, the , one with few if any new features and little new functionality.Carley's post confirmed that.\"Version 21H1 will be delivered to devices currently running Windows 10, version 2004 or version 20H2 using an enablement package,\" she said. \"This is the same technology we used to update devices from Windows 10, version 2004 to version 20H2.\"The  Carley mentioned was the tip-off, as that small code fragment is what transformed Windows 10 2004 into 20H2 last year. That was possible because 20H2  as 2004 as released and  as 2004 by the time 20H2 was to debut.(Confused? Microsoft built Windows 10 21H1 by taking October's 20H2, collected everything that changed from that point on \u2014 those changes had been issued in the monthly updates since October \u2014 and added a handful of new features. Voil\u00e0: Windows 10 21H1. Microsoft delivers these minor upgrades through the usual Windows Update/WIndows Update for Business/WSUS channels as the monthly cumulative update. The enablement package is essentially a command given to Windows to \"switch on\" the new version, since the code for it is already onboard.)Because Windows 10 21H1 is the second minor upgrade in a row, the enablement package mechanism works on all PCs running Windows 10 20H2  2004. Those enterprise systems running earlier versions of Windows 10 will have to download the entire OS to reach 21H1. (That, too, will be available, either as a  or through WSUS.)This is also the second update running that Microsoft has explicitly told commercial customers to start putting the version through the testing wringer. Last year,  for Windows 10 20H2 exactly two months before it unveiled the so-called upgrade to the public. It appears that Microsoft has decided to add this announcement to the servicing process when it's preparing to issue a minor upgrade.If Microsoft hews to the timetable of 2020 \u2014 announcement made two months prior to release \u2014 it will launch Windows 10 21H2 in the third week of May, perhaps May 20 or May 21.Ironically, Microsoft's declaration of open testing of Windows 10 21H1 may fail to move corporate IT personnel; the spring update, no matter whether major or minor, comes with only 18 months of support, a year shy of the 30 months awarded by each fall's refresh to the Windows 10 Enterprise and Education SKUs (stock-keeping units). Spring updates are, simply put, second class, and organizations are unlikely to bother deploying 21H1 unless forced to by circumstances, such as owning systems set to exhaust support in the next seven or eight months.With a May launch of Windows 10 21H1 almost certain, the version should receive support until Dec. 13, 2022."

It was the second version of Firefox without a top-ranked \"Critical\" bug.Firefox 87 can be downloaded for Windows, macOS and Linux from . Because Firefox updates in the background, most users can relaunch the browser to install the latest version. To manually update on Windows, pull up the menu under the three horizontal bars at the upper right, then click the help icon (the question mark within a circle). Choose \"About Firefox.\" (On macOS, \"About Firefox\" can be found under the \"Firefox\" menu.) The resulting page or pop-up shows that the browser is already up to date or displays the refresh process.Mozilla upgrades Firefox every four weeks; the last refresh was on Feb. 23.\"SmartBlock\" is easily the most significant addition to Firefox 87.\"Introducing a policy that outright blocks trackers on the web inevitably risks blocking components that are essential for some websites to function properly,\" Thomas Wisniewski, web compatibility engineer, said in a . \"This can result in images not appearing, features not working, poor performance, or even the entire page not loading at all.\"Mozilla has been clear about the trade-offs made when anti-tracking defenses are dialed up to : The company has regularly warned users that setting Firefox's Enhanced Tracking Protection to \"Strict,\" the most aggressive option, \"may cause some websites to not display content or work correctly.\"SmartBlock looks to address this downside by sliding dummy scripts into sites to replace those blocked by the tracking defenses.

Firefox 87 now trims this URL from its full path to the domain only, thus removing a large amount of the granularity trackers might provide, say, advertisers about what a user's browser last rendered.\"Firefox will apply the new default Referrer Policy to all navigational requests, redirected requests, and subresource (image, style, script) requests, thereby providing a significantly more private browsing experience,\" said Dimi Lee and Christoph Kerschbaumer, software development engineer and Firefox security infrastructure engineering manager, respectively, in a .Elsewhere in Firefox 87, Mozilla added tick marks to the scrollbar to denote instances of an executed \"Find in This Page\" command. The marks, however, are  faint and while not distracting are hard to see at anything close to a glance. Firefox also now supports the macOS native screen reader, VoiceOver.The next version, Firefox 88, will be released April 20."

Other drivers behind the increase include a rise in the number of knowledge workers globally, according to Gartner.\u201cThe need to suddenly empty out all the office buildings, while keeping businesses afloat, gave a jolt to many markets, with social and collaboration being one of those at the forefront,\u201d said Craig Roth, research vice president at Gartner and one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cSocial and collaboration products went from \u2018nice to have\u2019 to \u2018must have\u2019 within a period of a few weeks.\u201dOf the three areas covered in the report, collaborative work management tools \u2013 including the likes of ,  and Monday \u2013 were the biggest driver of revenue growth, as businesses sought to digitize \u201cnon-routine\u201d task management and coordination processes that would otherwise require back-and-forth emails. \u201cTracking and coordination of work outside of formal project plans became a lot more difficult when you couldn't just ask for status over a cube wall. These tools, which were on an upswing anyway, got an extra boost [during the pandemic],\u201d said Roth.The report also forecasts that collaborative and social functionality will increasingly be embedded into CRM, HR and ERP business applications.

Microsoft recently announced that its Teams collaboration tool will be , for example, while Salesforce\u2019s  is likely to bring tight integration across its suite of business apps.The advantage of embedding social and collaboration functionality is the ability to include non-formalized processes, such as conversations or content sharing, in more process-oriented business tools. \u00a0\u201cGoing forward, we\u2019ll start seeing [collaboration] products integrated more into packaged business applications, as opposed to being a siloed product on the side that, every now and then, you exit your business application to do some collaboration, and then go back to \u2018work,\u2019\u201d said Roth. \u201cIt shouldn't feel that way.\u201d"

Other applications will be brought into the program, Microsoft said, though no timeline was given.In an online document that detailed the new bug bounty program, Microsoft listed five specific scenarios \u2014 \"high-impact,\" the company said \u2014 that came with rewards from $6,000 to $30,000. The largest bounty was for vulnerabilities described as \"remote code execution (native code in the context of the current user) with no user interaction.\"Flaws in Teams that led to an \"ability to obtain authentication credentials for other users*(note: does not include phishing)\" would rate a maximum of $15,000.A rate sheet of general bugs \u2014 from remote code execution vulnerabilities to spoofing or tampering \u2014 was also included, with rewards ranging from $500 to $15,000, depending on the severity of the flaw, and the quality and thoroughness of the finder's reporting.In comparison, Microsoft's bounties in its  max out at $15,000.

  "title": "What the hell is happening with Android One?",
  "img_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/android-one-google-100882613-large.jpg",
  "contents": "Not long ago, a low-profile program called Android One looked like it could be just the one-two punch Android needed.Android One, like lots of Google initiatives, has had a long and winding history with plenty of twists and turns. When Android One first came into the picture in 2014, it was described as an effort to \"make high-quality smartphones accessible to as many people as possible.\" The focus was squarely on bringing affordable phones with exceptional experiences to emerging markets \u2014 places like Pakistan and India, where it could be \"hard for people\" to \"get their hands on a high-quality smartphone,\" as Google  at the time.But that was just the start of Google's Android One ambitions. Three years later, in 2017, Google  with the launch of Android One phones in places like Japan, Taiwan, and eventually the United States. The company changed its description of the effort from that original small-scale focus to the much broader vision of a \"collaboration between Google and [its] partners to deliver a software experience ,\" with a guarantee of reasonably timely ongoing operating system updates and an experience that'd be free from all the  and  baked into .Sound familiar? It should. It's basically the  we see with Google's own self-made Pixel phones, only scaled down a bit and with other manufacturers involved. Or, to zoom back even further into Android nerdland, it's incredibly similar to what we to see with  many moons ago \u2014 where Google would bring in other phone-makers to handle the hardware but then maintain complete control over the software, support, and overall user experience itself. (In the Nexus scenario, of course, the phones were branded as Google devices. But that surface-level distinction aside, the situation is almost eerily comparable.)Over the last few years, Android One has grown more and more mature, with a lineup of impressively decent budget-level and even midrange devices made by the likes of Nokia, LG, Motorola, and a handful of other companies. Those phones have consistently been ahead of the pack when it comes to the  of , with post-sales support that puts most other options \u2014 including those that cost four to five times as much \u2014 to shame.Lately, though, something strange has been happening. The once-thriving Android One program seems to have quietly faded into an almost forgotten footnote. The pace of new devices showing up in the program's virtual shelves has slowed down to a trickle, and the phones that  still alive and kickin' within the Android One walls are failing to meet their one-time promises of fast and frequent software updates.So what in the world is happening? I'm a curious creature, and I found myself scratching my wooly man-noggin to little result (aside from itch satiation) trying to figure it out. So I decided to dig a little deeper to see what I could find. And, well...Let's start with the first front \u2014 the dearth of recent Android One devices and the apparent lack of attention Google is devoting to the program (a program for which it had previously promised to provide \"major promotional dollars,\" according to a ).All you've gotta do is look at Google's official  to see the unavoidable signs that \u00a0unusual is afoot. Right under the top-of-page headline promising phones that are \"secure, up-to-date, and easy to use\" is a graphic showing the Nokia 5.3 \u2014 a phone that was announced an , last March, and is still running 2019's Android 10 software, nearly seven months after Android 11's release. Yeaaaaaaaaah. I'm no mathematician, but something sure doesn't seem to add up.And the disconnect only gets even more blatant from there: That primary front-and-center graphic with the Nokia 5.3 actually describes the phone as having \"the latest Android 10 operating system\" \u2014 despite the fact that Android 10 hasn't been \"the latest\"  since last September. Um, right.The other \"latest phones\" featured on the page aren't any better. One of the top devices shown on the Android One landing page, the Motorola One Action, came out at the end of October \u2014 in . It also has yet to receive the now-seven-month-old Android 11 update, despite being part of the Android One program.Motorola, for its part, seems to have mostly just moved on from its Android One focus. Confusingly, it's continued to release devices with that One branding as part of their titles \u2014 like last year's  and  \u2014 but it's seemingly reclaimed that branding as its own, without any of the Android One associations or promises.So what about Nokia \u2014 the company that  with Android One and that I once labeled as the \"\"? I reached out to that company's media relations department multiple times over the past week to ask for an explanation on both  to provide timely updates to its current crop of Android One phones and its sudden slowdown in new Android One device releases, and I've yet to receive any response.What we  say is that first, Nokia's had some public struggles over the past months \u2014 with reports  that the company could be \"exploring strategic options,\" including a possible sale or merger. (Those reports were later , but the fact that such talk is even out there is never a great sign.) Just this past Friday, the company's chief product officer and one of its most prominent public figures\u00a0 \u2014 which may or may not have any direct connection to whatever's going on with all of this, but again, doesn't help with the perception of an organization that's adrift.As for Google, I asked the company if there was anything it could share about whether Android One was still considered an active effort \u2014 and if so, what exactly was going on with (a) the considerable slowdown in new phones coming out within the Android One umbrella and (b) the apparent failure by practically\u00a0existing Android One device-maker to meet its timely software update promise in this latest upgrade cycle. In response, a company spokesperson sent me the following statement:I pressed a bit further and asked if there was anything more specific that could be said to explain the situation with all of the still-pending Android One software updates, some seven months after Android 11's release, as well as with the recent lull in new Android-One-associated device releases \u2014 but I haven't received any additional responses.There is, of course, one perfectly logical possible explanation to all of this \u2014 a narrative that ties all the pieces together and certainly  like a sensible answer to why Android One has gone from front and center to faded and forgotten. Rev up that beautiful mammal brain of yours: It's time to explore an all-too-plausible-seeming theory.Stay with me for a sec, 'cause there's some important context we need to think through to set the stage for this sudsy soap-opera drama. Back when Android One first expanded from its initial \"emerging market\" focus, y'see, my favorite writer in the world \u2014 an extraordinarily handsome and humble fella \u2014 made some astute observations about how the program could be the brilliantly conceived missing piece to Google's grand Android puzzle.Go, go, :Google already provided that same possibility with its own self-made Pixel phone, of course \u2014 but at the time, Google was selling only a single high-end (and high-priced, for that era) Pixel model. That meant the majority of phone buyers were never gonna get the Android experience Google clearly saw as being optimal \u2014 one that's cohesive and easy to use, that puts complementary Google services front and center, and that remains fresh and compelling for an extended period of time by way of reliable updates.And that's where Android One came into play: By offering a \"Pixel lite\" sort of experience at an affordable price, Google could bring  vision for how  wanted Android to appear to a much larger base of people \u2014 despite the fact that it wasn't ready to make its own lower-priced Pixel model at that point.To quote my favorite humble writer once more:So what's changed since then? Ding, ding, ding! You got it: Google started making affordable Android phone with its ideal software setup and self-controlled, super-speedy software updates. That's precisely what the  is all about, and with a price of 350 bucks, it brings the same optimized experience we first saw in the high-end Pixel into a much more affordable form. It\u00a0 the \"Pixel lite,\" without any of the asterisks Android One involves in comparison.With Google selling its own completely self-controlled Pixel phone for 350 smackeroos, then, what reason does it have left to really, truly care about Android One in the way it once did? The entire reason Android One originally benefitted Google is made mostly redundant and unnecessary by the Pixel \"a\" line's existence. For the most part, an Android One phone is a watered-down, lesser version of a Pixel \"a\" device, and it's typically sold for pretty darn close to the same price (sometimes even more).When you combine that fact with the shifting Android landscape \u2014 what we talked about a minute ago with Nokia combined with LG's , one-time Android One partner HTC's increased irrelevance, and the lack of any real motivation for an already-successful-on-its-own phone-maker like Samsung to participate in this sort of effort \u2014 it kinda makes sense that Android One would start to fizzle, doesn't it?I mean, think about: The program's most prominent players are all having their own issues, and Google simultaneously now has its own fully self-controlled product to serve the program's original purpose even more effectively. It also has the ultra-low-end-focused  to address the super-affordable, sub-$200 domain that the Pixel line doesn't (yet) cover. Really, it's no wonder the Android One promise and everything around it seem mostly out of mind.And you know what? This is admittedly reading between the lines, but if you look back at Google's statement on the subject, it seems almost deliberately worded to avoid saying anything substantial about the program's long-term fate. Yes, it says that Android One is a \"living program that continues to grow\" \u2014 but look closely at that last line (the emphasis here being mine):Nothing to announce about the program's future ? That sure isn't the same as saying \"This program isn't going anywhere, bucko!\" And continuing to work with partners to bring great Android devices to market? Note the lack of a mention of Android One, specifically, as part of that proposition.When I wrote about Android One's potential back in 2017, I noted how the effort could fill the then-glaring void of an optimal Google experience within Android at the sub-flagship price range. As I said at the time:Well, guess what? Here we are, four years later \u2014 and Google has taken that ambitious leap into the affordable Android phone market. It  invested the resources in developing its own devices at lower price points, and by most counts, the first Pixel \"a\"-line phones have , relatively speaking.Google may not be ready to pull the plug on Android One yet, but looking at all the variables surrounding the state of the program, it's hard not to wonder if the clock is already ticking\u00a0\u2014 and, in one way or another, if it's just a matter of time until the seconds run out."

  "contents": "Apple has : WWDC 2021 will be an all-online event once again \u2014 a tacit acknowledgement of \u00a0the \u00a0last year.WWDC 2021 will run between June 7-11, be free to developers, and will \u201cbuild on the record-breaking participation and learnings from last year\u2019s online conference,\u201d the company said in a statement.The event is open to Apple\u2019s global community of 28 million developers. The show will feature the annual keynote and State of the Union announcements, online sessions, and 1:1 labs for technical guidance. Intriguingly, Apple also promises: \u201cNew ways for developers to interact with Apple engineers and designers to learn about the latest frameworks and technologies.\u201cWe love bringing our developers together each year at WWDC to learn about our latest technologies and to connect them with Apple engineers,\u201d said Susan Prescott, Apple\u2019s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations and Enterprise and Education Marketing.\u00a0\u201cWe are working to make WWDC21 our biggest and best yet, and are excited to offer Apple developers new tools to support them as they create apps that change the way we live, work, and play.\u201d\u00a0The company plans to share more information pertaining to the giant developer event later, via the , on the, and by email.It was inevitable, really. COVID-19 continues to blight lives and one year later we know more about the threat it represents.\u00a0Not only does the disease mutate, but \u00a0is neither complete, nor fully international.This is true to such an extent that it makes no sense to combine an international collection of Apple\u2019s most important supporters, partners, and followers in a public space. I think we\u2019ll see the potential damage of such mixing at MWC 2021, which still\u00a0 to take place.The decision also matches Apple\u2019s outlook. The company does not expect to mandate a\u00a0 at the earliest.Apple CEO Tim Cook has \u00a0with what his employees have achieved. The company has also pushed hard to play its part in the struggle against the pandemic \u2014 it has invested way too much cash and energy in this to undermine that good work with a premature attempt at returning to normal.The company certainly won\u2019t want to squeeze thousands of its most important personnel, staff, and partners into long-distance flights, exposing all parties to risk.These considerations will have formed part of the company\u2019s thinking on the matter. The fact that it achieved such a successful event in 2020 shows that it is possible to yield a good outcome from a bad situation.\u00a0It may, however, prove interesting to find out just what Apple has developed in terms of new virtual experiences for collaboration during the event.Apple is once again giving students who code a chance to take part in the  This year\u2019s challenge has an interactive edge. It is to create an interactive scene in Swift Playground that can be experienced inside three minutes. Students have until April 18 to submit their work and winners will receive exclusive WWDC21 outerwear and a pin set.With thousands of visitors every year, WWDC usually brings a lot of money to local businesses in San Jose and beyond. In a gesture of solidarity, Apple is contributing $1 million to SJ Aspires, an education and equity initiative from the City of San Jose. The scheme aims to enable youth from underserved neighbourhoods to access a college education.There are probable, possible, and potential announcements likely at WWDC.Primarily, Apple will discuss its platforms and software, which will be evidenced in first glances st new iterations of its operating systems. Those are the probables.Apple\u2019s big hint of possible \u2014 new interactive tools \u2014 suggests much more exploration around platforms and solutions for collaboration in virtual space.\u00a0That\u2019s not an especially new focus for the AR-invested company, but does show how much more relevant to daily lives such technology is becoming.Apple will almost certainly want to discuss the Apple\u00a0, which makes some form of Mac announcement possible.All of these possibles also open the door to potential news, almost certainly around AR development \u2014 though all  suggests introduction of v.1 Apple AR glasses won\u2019t take place until 2022.Perhaps Apple has some  up its sleeve?"

  "contents": "Microsoft has begun rolling out its Windows release health dashboard to the Microsoft 365 admin portal, a move the company previewed earlier this month at its all-virtual Ignite conference.\"This will be a phased rollout and we expect this information experience to be available to all applicable customers by the end of April,\" Mabel Gomes, senior communications program manager in the Windows group, said in a .The original Windows release health launched almost two years ago as one of the changes Microsoft instituted after the disastrous debut of Windows 10 1809, the fall 2018 version of the operating system that had to be yanked from release because it deleted data.That dashboard \u2014 later labeled a \"hub\" \u2014 has offered information on current rollout status and known issues, both open and closed cases, for all Windows 10 updates. Notably, the hub was the one public location where Microsoft posted information about all Windows 10 , issues that have prevented machines from upgrading to the next refresh (and thus marked the systems Microsoft would refuse to offer an update).The public release health hub\u00a0.The Windows release health being added to the Microsoft 365 admin center will be similar but not identical to the existing hub; essentially, it will be \"public hub-plus.\"\"Because the admin center is specifically designed for IT admins, you will find greater technical detail about known issues, earlier reminders about important milestones like end of service, and more resources to help you plan for and deploy Windows updates,\" Gomes wrote about the release health add-in. \"Our goal is to help you diagnose issues in your environment fast, provide steps to mitigate them quickly, and provide a root cause analysis for better support.\"To access Windows release health in the admin portal, customers must be subscribers to Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3/A3/F3, Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5/A5, Windows 10 Enterprise E3/A3 or Windows 10 Enterprise E5/A5.Interestingly, Microsoft denied that release health \"monitor[s] user environments or collect customer environment information,\" to, for example, post blocker information specific to the OS version(s) being run by an organization. In the next breath, though, Microsoft acknowledged that \"future iterations of [release health] may target content based on customer location, industry, or Windows version.\"The latter would seem to be a selling point for release health in the admin center, since it would only display information that \u00a0affected the firm's own Windows 10 PCs. Most likely, if or when Microsoft  focus release health on the on-premises devices, it will use the telemetry collected by the operating system to do so, the same telemetry utilized by Desktop Analytics (n\u00e9e Windows Analytics).A more detailed explanation of what the admin center's release health component offers can be found on . Currently, only the cloud-based portal includes release health. Microsoft said that it's working on integrating release health with the  \u2014 iOS and Android \u2014 \"in a future release.\""

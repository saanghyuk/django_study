"The 2020 calendar year will long be remembered as an annus horribilis for most, except for a handful of technology companies who reaped the rewards of a global shift to remote work with  successful initial public offerings (IPOs).US companies alone raised a record $435 billion in stock sales in 2020, with more than a quarter of that figure coming from IPOs — far outstripping 2014's mark of $279 billion, according to data compiled by . The vast majority of those new listings defined themselves as technology companies.Cloud-based software firms like Zoom, Snowflake, Asana, Airbnb and Palantir all , and continue to see their stock price flourish as remote work and e-commerce continue to be the norm for many into 2021.The question now is whether this trend will continue through the year. There are a host of companies eying an early debut in 2021 to take advantage of favorable conditions. But, as with all market debuts, timing will be everything, with a number of industry analysts   of a .Here are the biggest technology IPOs of the year so far.DigitalOcean had a disappointing  on March 24, with its stock sinking 9.6% on its first day. The New York-based cloud firm initially priced its IPO at $47, which was on the top end of the expected range of $44 to $47. It closed its first day at $42.50 a share, valuing the company at $4.5 billion.DigitalOcean promises a simple platform for software developers to quickly spin up and host applications in the cloud on virtual private servers (VPS); it competes with the big cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and other Platform as a Service providers such as Heroku, a Salesforce company, and VPS vendors like Linode.Like many tech companies at IPO, DigitalOcean is not profitable, having registered a net loss of $44 million on revenue of $318 million in 2020.Reviews website  floated on the London Stock Exchange on March 23, where its stock surged by as much as 11% on debut, hitting £2.95 a share, up from its offer price of £2.65 ($3.65). That puts the company value at £1.1 billion.The Danish firm collates independent reviews for online businesses and counted as many as 120 million reviews by the end of 2020, for everything from utilities providers to yoga studios. It makes money by selling subscriptions to businesses who want to engage with consumer reviews in their marketing campaigns. Its revenue was up 25% in 2020, reaching $102 million at a loss of $12.2 million.Food-ordering software maker Olo raised $450 million in an initial public offering on March 17. The New York-based SaaS company sold 18 million shares at $25 each, above its pre-IPO range of $20 to $22, valuing the company at $3.55 billion.Olo software powers loyalty programs and allows restaurants to manage orders and menus and currently counts a range of US-based customers including Five Guys, California Pizza Kitchen, and The Cheesecake Factory.Utah-based software company Qualtrics went public on Jan. 28, just two years after its $8 billion  on the eve of its first planned IPO in 2018.Qualtrics initially priced its IPO at $30 per share, which was the top end of its expected range, before popping a massive 52% on its Nasdaq debut. It closed at $45.50 a share, valuing the firm at $27.3 billion.Founded by brothers Ryan and Jared Smith alongside their father and fourth co-founder Stuart Orgill,  before growing into a platform for large companies like Disney,  and  to collect a variety of ""experience data"" from employees and customers.Qualtrics fared pretty well as part of the SAP family, growing revenue 30% in the first three quarters of 2020 to $550 million. It did continue to operate at a loss of $244 million however, with $218 million of stock-based compensation skewing that number pretty dramatically.SAP will maintain majority ownership of the vendor post-IPO, and private equity firm Silver Lake now owns a little over 4% of the stock. Ryan Smith has somewhat stepped away from the day-to-day running of Qualtrics since  last year.Other companies rumored to be lining up a 2021 IPO include Instacart, ZipRecruiter, Coursera, Bumble, Squarespace, and Coinbase.",https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015/09/volitale-up-down-market-stocks-mixed-100613916-large.jpg,Biggest tech IPOs of 2021
"Microsoft's decision in February to strip an identifier used for decades from some Windows update release notes continues to draw the ire of customers.On Feb. 18, the company announced on its Windows IT Pro blog that it would no longer include the KB identifier —  for Knowledge Base — in the URLs of all online release notes associated with Windows update release details. The KB identifiers have been used by Microsoft for several decades to pinpoint individual bug fixes and guide customers to the appropriate documentation.""One of the primary ways that many find release notes is through the use of a KB identifier (KBID),"" Christine Ahonen, a program manager at Microsoft, wrote in the . ""We use a unique identifier for each Windows update. Once a KBID is created, it is then used to identify the update throughout the release process, including documentation.""Ahonen noted that the KB identifier was used in not only the title of the release note but more importantly, in URL of that note, in the format .But such wouldn't be the standard in the future.""For instance, the URL structure of  is still supported, however, it will redirect to a newly formatted URL ,"" Ahonen said. (, aka  is a Microsoft-specific 128-bit integer — consisting of 8 hexadecimal digits, followed by three groups of 4 hexadecimal digits each, followed by one group of 12 hexadecimal digits — used to identify, in this case, a specific release note.) ""Additionally, if a KBID appears in the title of a page, it will appear in the URL. If a KBID is not in the title, it will not appear in the URL. Types of articles where you may not find a KBID include informational articles and articles released for non-cumulative updates or specialty packages.""Ahonen did not initially divulge the reason for the change.Users reacted immediately to the announcement. And none applauded it.""Why can't you just add it (the KD identifier) to the URL?"" asked  in a comment. ""You've got a title and a huge GUID there already. KBID isn't an overhead. But no, you make us view or parse the source. Your approach doesn't make sense, but you don't really bother to explain it.""""Hold the phone. Enough. Don't mess with my KB numbers,"" wrote  in another comment. (Bradley, who publishes the Windows tip newsletter , also contributes to Computerworld as .) This is how we all 'speak' in terms of patches, patch management, etc.""Clearly this is making it easier  but not . You remember us? Your customers? The ones you should be making happy? If it is a KB, then it needs to have a . Period.""Others echoed Sterkin and Bradley. ""When tackling updates, it's very common for me to just type  into the address bar,"" said someone identified as . ""This is a terrible change, and I fail to see the benefit of it in any way.""On March 4, Ahonen returned to the then-dormant comment section of her post from weeks before with news about the decision to drop the KB identifier.""This is the result of our change over to a new Content Management System (CMS),"" . ""This new CMS does not support the old URL patterns and so we needed to adapt to the new structure.""To have this function like the old system, we have added redirectors to use both older patterns:""Typing either one of these old patterns will take you to the new URL,"" Ahonen continued. ""You can still link to the old URL patterns and it will take you or your customers to the correct location.""Ahonen also said that  Windows servicing update article would have the appropriate KB identifier in its title, including all security updates as well as all non-security updates. ""These articles will be fully searchable,"" she said.The automatic-redirection, however, didn't solve the problem caused by Microsoft scrubbing the KB identifier from some URLs, Bradley argued. ""Could you determine the KB number easily from that page?"" she asked, referring to the URL of a release note for a problem she had encountered. ""I can't visually see that KB number ... easily anymore. None of these changes make our jobs easier.""Ahonen commiserated with Bradley in a .""I agree that it is frustrating not to be able to find the KBID on the page or in the URL for some of these outlying articles,"" she said. ""We are looking at various solutions to work around the limitation."" Ahonen also urged users to continue providing feedback. ""The more we understand the way that customers use these IDs the better our resolution will be.""She gave no hint, however, that the removal of KB identifiers would be reversed — not surprising considering it's connected to the new CMS platform, a serious investment in any instance.Bradley countered with a final example. ""This was an update widely pushed to our machines, it wasn't an outlying article,"" Bradley wrote in a , offering the support document's title and one-line description, neither of which included a KB identifier. ""If something is going to be pushed through the Windows Update channel, it needs a KB front and center.""",https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/06/patch_and_update_options_pixelized_tools_and_refresh_symbol_with_branching_paths_by_pashaignatov_gettyimages-1152709304-100800559-large.jpg,Users condemn Microsoft for removing KB IDs from some bug documentation
"LogMeIn has  to GoToConnect, its Unified Communications and Collaboration (UCC) software, including native integrations with Microsoft Teams; updates to its Cloud Contact Center-as-a-Service (CCaaS) systems; updates to its mobile offering; and bundling options that bring together other LogMeIn products like LastPass, GoToWebinar, and GoToAssist.The moves reflect shifts in how people are working because of the pandemic, with employees no longer tied to the same desk in an office from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., five days a week.The shift to remote work is likely to continue, according to Raul Castanon, senior analyst in workforce productivity and collaboration at 451 Research S&P Global Market intelligence.Recent 451 Research indicates that 45% of companies expect to reduce their physical office footprint, while 37% will expand or add collaboration spaces such as conference rooms and huddle rooms, he said. Another 45% are investing in contactless technologies such as biometrics and voice user interfaces and 17% are replacing on-premises PBX with cloud-based telephony.Paul Gentile, senior director of product marketing at LogMeIn, said IT decision makers need to think about ways to optimize the software they use to ensure that hybrid work is, “[successful] for employees that need support and for customers that they're going to interact and engage with them in a different way.They also need to tie in security measures, because as IT decision makers that report into a CTO or CIO, there’s always going to be concern about how much vulnerability they have at stake,"" Gentile ssid. ""The idea that remote work is really related to and only focuses on video conferencing or video meetings is a fallacy.""The updated  offers users a new mobile UI designed to make employees more productive by, for example, allowing them to receive and make work calls on a mobile device without using their personal number. It also offers features such as Find Me and Follow Me, Advance Call Flip, Shared Extension, and Voicemail Transcriptions.LogMeIn is also looking to bolster productivity in cloud-based contact centers, which have proved crucial to some companies' ability to maintain business continuity.“Those cloud deployments are going to be more critical than ever before when customers start to think about optimizing their tech stack,” said Gentile. “It’s not just with UCC, but with our remote support and management solutions, with our security identity and access management solution with LastPass password protection. We’ve created one single SKU, one delivery mechanism for all of these pieces brought together under one roof.""Native integrations have also been made with Microsoft Teams to simplify and improve workflow. These allow users to continue to use Microsoft Teams with GoToConnect, powering their telephony service on the back end with direct routing capabilities. It also supports features such as click-to-call and user presence without having to switch out of the Teams app.Castanon said the updates announced this week should be welcome news for LogMeIn customers “Features such as an enhanced mobility experience and voicemail transcriptions, as well as enhanced admin and support capabilities, should allow the company to better address the requirements of the hybrid/remote workforce,” he said.According to Gentile, conversations with customers and analysts over the past year found that most customers are looking to simplify their tech offerings, with buyers turning to one vendor/one platform options or best-of-breed offerings — all of them underpinned by cloud technology.“Some employers went rogue in the way that they went about using different remote tools [at the start of the pandemic]. Now, 2021 is about them trying to consolidate, getting their arms back around this [issue] and doing so, while still maintaining the idea that you can be anywhere you want, and still be productive,” he said.In a post-pandemic world, Gentile said work tools need to be flexible, cloud-based, secure, and easy to buy, deploy, and use. “...Simplicity is paramount as far as them being able to make ... sure that they're saving dollars,"" he said. varies, depending on what level of service a company wants and how many employees it has. Costs range from $22 to $39 per user per month.Castanon said remote work will continue to be an option for many workers for the forseeable future.“This is an intensely competitive space; however, it’s fair to say that LogMeIn has a leg up with products such as LastPass and GoToAssist which were designed for these use cases,"" he said. ""Bringing them together to enhance GoToConnect could allow the company to position itself as a UCC platform for hybrid/remote workforce and differentiate from its competition.""",https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/visual-configuration-min-png-100880421-large.jpg,LogMeIn revamps GoToConnect to support shift to flexible work
"To say this year's Android upgrade performance has been a letdown would be one heck of an understatement.Sure, you could point out the  showing that Android 11's adoption is the best of any recent  in terms of how many phones are running the software as of this six-month mark. And sure, that's certainly .But you know what? That's a pretty frickin' low bar to set. When we're talking about a major new Android release — software that's filled with important  that affect how both Android itself and third-party apps are allowed to interact with your data — merely having a fifth of all Android phones running the thing  after its release isn't exactly a win worth celebrating.My data-driven  says it all. Using the same standard formula I've relied on to grade Android device-makers for nearly a decade now (related: I am 700 years old), I found that outside of Google, every major U.S. flagship phone-maker did enough to earn only a D-level or flat-out failing grade with its Android 11 upgrade deliveries. The  score in this year's ranking was a measly 68% D+. And things only get worse from there.Even so, what's listed in that latest Report Card isn't the biggest disappointment of all. Yes, everyone outside of Google can and do better at getting current software out to their highest-paying customers in a reasonably timely manner — but quite frankly, at this point, most of those letdowns are .The biggest disappointment is actually something that's just a tiny asterisk in the sea of Android — something not even significant enough to earn a place in that Upgrade Report Card analysis. But it's something that had represented a tiny glimmer of promise in the bigger Android picture and something I had would be a shining highlight of this conversation.I'm talking about the way Microsoft — yes, Microsoft! — is handling software support on its first and thus-far-only self-made Android product, the pricey and unusual .The Surface Duo?! Who cares — right? Believe me, I get it. Microsoft's inaugural Android hardware effort hasn't exactly been a home run or a phone that's made anything more than a pebble-sized splash in the greater Android ocean. But as I've said , the story of the Duo is less about the admittedly imperfect specifics of this single initial product and more about the broader view of what it could show us about Microsoft's mobile ambitions — what it could , in other words, with future generations of devices.And part of what I was really hoping to see revealed — something I called the , in fact — was whether Microsoft could manage to shake up the sad state of Android upgrades.It's not such a crazy notion to consider. Think about it: Outside of Google, most other Android device-makers have absolutely no motivation to make timely and ongoing post-sales software support a priority — so really, it's no surprise that we see the sorts of halfhearted, tortoise-paced efforts that we do with Android upgrade delivery. Companies like Samsung and Motorola make their money mostly by hawking hardware. Software updates require time and resources, and the companies doing all that legwork don't get anything tangible back in return. If anything, frequent updates actually work  most phone-makers' interests, as they make you less likely to feel the need to go out and buy a shiny new device.Traditionally within Android, Google has been the sole exception to that rule — since Google's motivated to keep you using your phone (and thus the internet and its services) as much as possible and with as pleasant of an experience as it can muster up. Even if you don't buy new phones all that often, after all, Google still benefits from having you online, engaged, and ecstatic about your Android setup.Microsoft, interestingly enough, is fairly similar. Just like with Google, hardware sales aren't the primary focus of that company's business. Instead, it relies mostly on  to make its money. The hardware is mostly just a way to bring you further into the Microsoft ecosystem — an ecosystem Microsoft has worked painstakingly to .To quote  of the most handsome and humble writer I know:The Surface Duo, despite its relative insignificance within the Android landscape and within my Report Card at this point, was the first test of how Microsoft might fare in that department. And what's happened?Well, I'll tell ya, Tito: nada. Precisely bupkis. Microsoft hasn't done a damn thing to show any signs of taking operating system upgrades seriously on its first Android device. Six months past the launch of Android 11, the Duo is sitting on increasingly stale, now 18-months-old and out-of-date software. For a company that makes a point of updating its own Windows operating system every seven to 14 seconds — and a company that most certainly knows the value of maintaining current, optimally up-to-date software, particularly when it comes to business situations — that's not only disappointing; it's pathetic.Worse yet, Microsoft hasn't made a peep, officially, about what's going on and if and when the Duo  see Android 11. Unofficially,  the phone could get the update — which, mind you, was released in early September of 2020 — sometime ""this summer.""Depending on when exactly that ends up happening, that'd make the upgrade anywhere from nine to a whopping 12 months late. By August or September (both which are still part of summer), we'll be well on our way to seeing the  Android version, , out in the wild. And Microsoft's self-made product might just be getting the previous, already on-the-brink-of-being-outdated release.That'd be unacceptable for Android phone — even an inexpensive one. For a phone that folks forked out $1,400 for, it's bordering on insulting. And for a phone that comes from a company with Microsoft's history, capabilities, business focus, and experience delivering timely and reliable software updates, it's almost embarrassingly pitiful.I'd like to think Microsoft could still redeem itself and turn things around with future Duo generations, but Goog almighty, it's got an awful lot of improving to accomplish. I don't know that any other company in this arena has come in with so much promise and then fallen so quickly to such a staggering level of disappointment.So come on, Microsoft: Try to exert at least a teensy bit of effort with this, would ya? Even your old pal Clippy's gotta be hangin' his pretty little paperclip head in shame right now.",https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/android-upgrade-disappointment-100880234-large.jpg,This year's biggest Android upgrade disappointment
"Microsoft, as expected, has synchronized the release schedule of its Edge browser with Chrome's, which Google had earlier announced would accelerate to an every-four-week cadence.""As contributors to the Chromium project, we look forward to the new 4-week major release cycle cadence that Google announced, to help deliver that innovation to our customers even faster,"" the Edge team wrote in an unsigned .The week prior,  to match that of Mozilla's Firefox by reducing the current six-to-eight-week schedule to just four weeks. The change won't happen overnight, but instead will take place in the fall, when the span between versions 94 and 95 will fall to four weeks.Chrome 94 is set to release Sept. 21; Chrome 95 is to launch Oct. 19. Microsoft will hew to the same schedule. ""This change in release cycles is expected to start with Edge 94,"" Microsoft said, while pointing to a fleshed-out .(Microsoft has gotten into the habit of releasing the same-numbered Edge two days after the comparable Chrome upgrade. Because Google issues updates on Tuesdays, that means Microsoft does on Thursdays. The likely release date for Edge 94, then, will be Sept. 23, and that of Edge 95, Oct. 21.)Because Microsoft has hitched Edge to Chromium's wagon — the open-source project is responsible for building and maintaining the core technologies for Chrome, and since January 2020, Edge — the Redmond, Wash. company had little choice but to go along with the change to release timing. The only alternative would have been to delay Edge releases, obviously unacceptable.Although Chromium's work is used by numerous browsers — Brave and Opera, for example, as well as Edge — Google calls most of the shots; not only did Google start Chromium, but its engineers continue to dominate its work. It's unclear, for instance, what voice, if any, Microsoft (and other makers) had in the release acceleration.Also per Google's plans, Microsoft will offer a less-frequently updated edition of Edge aimed at commercial customers. This ""Extended Stable"" release will upgrade every eight weeks — thus skipping every other build — but will be serviced by security updates on a two-week tempo. Extended Stable will only be available to organizations that manage their machines.The eight-week schedule of Chrome and now Edge pales in comparison to that of Firefox, whose Extended Support Release, or ESR, forswears feature and functionality changes for more than a year. (ESR receives all security updates normally.)Last week was also a milestone for Edge: on March 9, Microsoft ended support for the original browser by that name.Debuting as part of Windows 10 in mid-2015, the so-called ""legacy"" Edge never caught on. Rather than see it waste away, Microsoft abandoned its own home-ground rendering and scripting technologies and took up Chromium's, first offering the new Edge in a stable form 14 months ago.With the end of support, legacy Edge will be a risk to run, as vulnerabilities will not be patched. Obviously, Microsoft wants its users to adopt the Chromium-fied Edge rather than switch to, say, Chrome or Firefox. To that end, next month's Windows 10 cumulative update — slated to arrive April 13 — will .",https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/01/microsoft_edge_browser_logo_3x2_1420x947-100875407-large.jpg,"Microsoft follows Google and Chrome, shifts Edge to four-week release pace"
"After a year of dealing with pandemic-related issues, C-suite leaders now find themselves focused on the “employee experience,” according to Chuck Friedman, Microsoft’s corporate vice president in charge of the company’s new Viva platform., which the company highlighted at this year’s , is designed to provide digital tools to support remote workers. , it is an employee experience platform (EXP), with four modules focused on employee engagement, well-being, learning, and knowledge.Though interest in employee experience had been on the rise, said Friedman, it took off last year as businesses switched to a largely remote-work model and had to deal with issues such as access to online training and development, maintaining company culture, and even avoiding burnout.As the COVID-19 pandemic shut down offices worldwide, “suddenly we moved from a workplace [where] people could be next to each other to a remote workplace where the demand for these things moved to digital,” Friedman said. “All of these things starting to come together…,” leading to Viva.As with all areas of digital transformation, the need to  — everything from HR applications to workforce analytics and employee engagement — boomed during the pandemic, said Raul Castanon, a senior research analyst at 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence. About four out of five businesses (78%) see supporting remote workers as a challenge over the next two years, according to 451, with employee experience issues — such as work-life balance, access to technology, team morale, and employee retention — among top concerns.As a result, said Friedman, an issue that had largely fallen on human resources has grown in importance among senior business leaders. “That [responsibility] has fundamentally changed,” he said, “and the entire C-suite is now thinking about the experience of their employees: How do they retain employees, how do they maintain morale of their employees?”Pre-pandemic, HR was closely involved with the employee experience, particularly  employee engagement, while CIOs, IT managers ,and line of business (LOB) leaders focused more on technology adoption and change management, said Castanon.“What we’re seeing now post-pandemic is a convergence and a growing overlap that is leading to cooperation between these areas…. HR is increasingly concerned with productivity, IT with employee engagement, LOB managers with both, and so on,” he said.Matt Cain, a Gartner vice president and distinguished analyst, said in a report that Viva is likely to “elevate the prominence” of employee experience technology in IT circles, and should lead to increased interest in a variety of services, “requiring greater levels of IT and HR collaboration.”At Ignite, Microsoft offered up more details about the four Viva modules – Connections, Insights, Learning and Topics. Among the updates is the introduction of a desktop app for Viva Connections, the company-branded intranet portal that uses SharePoint on Yammer and provides access to news, conversations, and other resources. The desktop app will be available this month, with a mobile version due this summer. The Connections module will be available at no extra cost to existing Microsoft 365 customers.Viva Learning — which serves up an organization’s custom content along with resources from Microsoft’s LinkedIn Learning and third-party providers — will arrive as a public preview in April. Pricing and subscription details will be released when that module becomes available, said Microsoft.Viva Insights, the analytics module that combines elements of the existing MyAnalytics personal productivity tracker and Workplace Analytics team-wide metrics, is now in public preview. At Ignite, Microsoft touted a “virtual commute” feature available in preview next month, and an integration with the Headspace guided meditation app arriving later in the year. Insights is available at no extra cost to Microsoft 365 users, with the organization-level insights accessed as an add-on via Workplace Analytics.Microsoft Viva Topics is the only generally available module currently, and costs $5 per user each month.Friedman said early interest in the platform has come from companies of all sizes. While Microsoft has worked closely with large enterprises on Viva, Friedman sees the platform as a good fit for smaller businesses, too.“I think the problem is universal; small- and medium-sized businesses have the same set of challenges and they need the same set of tools,” he said, noting that different businesses will gravitate to various aspects of Viva.“Frontline worker-focused companies are looking at learning and skilling as a real opportunity,” he said, arguing that Viva Connections can keep non-office-based workers in the loop with their wider organization via their mobile device. And information workers can use of Insights to address burnout, for instance.  A key aspect of Viva is the availability of its modules within Microsoft’s Teams collaboration platform, which has 115 million daily active users. But Friedman acknowledged the danger of overloading users with too much information and too many notifications.Microsoft worked to design a user interface (UI) that minimizes information overload, Friedman said. He pointed to Viva Connections, which can serve as a front-end UI within Teams to highlight .“The Connections module has the ability to compose all of the Viva capabilities and communicate with a single voice,” he said. “I'm hopeful we can simplify some of the UI inside Teams by using Connections as a sort of front end, a highlighted experience, as opposed to the idea of many different applications trying to reach the employee at the same time.”Machine learning can also help pick the right time for notifications. “When you're in the middle of an interview, it's probably not the right time for a learning [notification] to pop up and say, 'Hey, Chuck — do you want to take some learning right now?'” he said. “We’re going to … use the right moments of the day to [be] proactive in communication.“The flip side is if you bury things too deeply,” said Friedman. “Learning is another great example. The Learning content exists in many companies today, but when an employee wants to go and learn something new, they often have a hard time finding it.”With Viva Insights, Microsoft wants the analytics available in Microsoft 365 to be more accessible by employees, managers, and business leaders. for many collaboration and productivity vendors, and Microsoft’s existing MyAnalytics and Workplace Analytics are central within Viva.Microsoft came under fire for another of its analytics tools last year, ;  it highlighted a worker’s application use to Microsoft 365 admins before changes were announced to anonymize and aggregate data at the individual level.Friedman said maintaining employee privacy is important in Viva. “We will build clarity into the UI around what data is shown and what data is not. We’re doing many things on the back-end to make sure that we are only showing aggregate data, that we are removing anything that's personally identifiable….Then we will build reinforcement methods into the UI and transparency around why they can trust the data, who has access to it, that type of experience.”At the same time, Friedman said there are benefits to both workers and business leaders in analytics data.“…There’s value in transparency around things like goals, things like purpose for the team,” he said. “We want to help managers do an increasingly effective job of communicating to their teams, what their team is focused on, and then show aggregate sentiment through tools like Glint: 'When you made this announcement or when you announced this set of goals for your team, here's what the impact was on the team.'”With Viva services at various levels of availability and the likelihood of more modules on the way, Microsoft is just getting started — and analysts see room for expansion. In his report, Cain described Viva’s modules as “starting investments, rather than fully fledged mature services with clear and tangible business value.”While Microsoft calls Viva an employee experience platform, Gartner classifies it as an example of EXTech, “a diverse collection of employee-facing applications designed to influence and improve the employee experience and organizational culture,” said Cain.“A fully realized employee experience platform would have a broader top-level organizational structure, address a much larger set of touchpoints and interactions, and meet the needs of a variety of employee types, including desk-less or frontline workers.”Castanon said Microsoft’s investment in Viva amounts to the most ambitious attempt to provide a unified platform for employee experience so far.“We expect there will be additional capabilities and modules added,” he said. “However, as it stands it is probably among the most comprehensive EXP currently available.”Unifying various tools can help businesses adapt to remote work in the long term, he said, and Viva’s comprehensive approach could be “instrumental for organizations looking to tackle the challenges of the ‘new normal,’” such as “managing employee productivity and engagement for a distributed workforce, and understanding the complexities that enabling secure remote collaboration entails.“This will require a broader organizational transformation effort; the Viva platform could be instrumental for enabling this transformation,” Castanon said.“We're at this category-creation moment,” said Friedman. In that sense, he said, Microsoft’s strategy differs from that of Office 365, where well-established products were packaged as a subscription. Although Viva modules rely heavily on existing Microsoft 365 services such as SharePoint, Yammer, and MyAnalytics, the services represent a new focus and new modes of interaction based on the employee experience.“I would say we're early in this journey,” he said. “Very often, when Microsoft engages it's a better-established category. I don't think employee experience platforms as a category are fully defined yet, and that's exciting; you can point in a lot of directions….“We expect that this will evolve over time; we're investing intentionally in being a leader in the space.”",https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/02/viva-insights-100876130-large.jpg,"WFH boom makes ‘employee experience’ a C-suite priority, says Microsoft Viva chief"

"Developers should beware, as cybercriminals have figured out that the best attack vectors to infect the Apple ecosystem may be the developers themselves.We’ve known for a long time that malware makers and other cyber-miscreants are smart. The work they do brings in real money, with a healthy trade in corporate and personal secrets, bank account details, fraud, and ransomware generating a market some say is already worth billions — even as it .You can argue about the economic consequences, but there’s little doubt that the  generated a spike in socially engineered attacks, from fraudulent websites to phishing and beyond. And while the , with the majority of serious incidents stemming from weak user security practises and successful manipulation using traditional attack vectors such as malware-infested emails and website links, the pandemic has also seen .With  deployed in 2020 apparently being Macs, Apple’s platforms are becoming keen targets for criminal enterprise. The problem for criminals: Apple’s inherently solid security, along with the capacity to rush security upgrades out to millions of users because of the company’s non-fragmented platforms, makes doing so quite difficult.In response, attackers appear to be returning to the drawing board and now seem to be working to inject attacks early on in the process. The way they see it is that if you can’t persuade people to download Apple malware, you need to inject it inside applications users already trust.The latest illustration of this (“XcodeSpy”) has been identified by a team of security . They claim to have found an infected code library in the wild that attempts to install malware on Macs used by software developers. It comes as a copy of a legitimate open-source project Xcode users might choose to build animated tab bars.Once installed, this software quietly executes a script that downloads backdoor software that monitors what the developer does via the microphone, camera and keyboard.While this sounds pretty rough, it’s no reason for over-reaction. But it should serve as a warning to Apple developers in all walks of life, (particularly in enterprise IT) to ensure they are completely certain of what third-party tools and open-source packages they use when building applications.notes another recent incident of malware aimed at developers, when what were thought to be state-sponsored hackers engaged in an extensive campaign to win trust from security researchers via social media to convince them to install malware.In a sense, the shape of this particular set of security adventures was set in 2015 when , a version of Apple’s developer tool that was given a little extra zing in the form of built-in malware. Apps built using XcodeGhost all shipped with malware installed. While this attack was mostly confined to the APAC region, it  for apps containing code built by XCodeGhost to stop circulating.  The logic here makes complete sense. Even in Apple’s curated App Store model, iPhone, iPad, and Mac customers have built a big sense of trust in the way they download and install software.Indeed given that Apple continues to add friction to the experience of downloading software from outside its stores, malware makers know that the best way to distribute their wares is via the App Store itself.This must ultimately be the prize they seek — to build an attack mechanism that silently infects enough developers of legitimate Apple apps so that the apps they then sell via Apple’s store carry malware into devices belonging to millions of users.This hasn’t happened yet, and I think that Apple’s store security, software code checking, and verification tools mean it may never happen at all. But this is certainly part of what Apple’s customers and developers pay for in their App Store distribution fees.What makes this of a little more concern is that this latest alert follows just months after , again by targeting developers.The bottom line?Apple’s highly secure platforms are tough to break, but there’s a big profit motive to try to do so.Given that the weakest link in any security chain is now and always has been the user, no surprise then that those with a nose for this kind of security subversion are spending time figuring out how to trick developers into unwittingly becoming their own secret attack vectors.I think this means developers in the Apple ecosystem will need to security audit their software code repositories a little more often in future. Because you have been identified as potentially being the weakest link in the security chain.It would also be a good time to review  and this (older, but still useful) .",https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/11/industrial-power-plant_hacked_skull-and-crossbone-pixels_security-breach-power-plant_by-jason-blackeye-via-unsplash-and-thinkstock-100818605-large.jpg,Hackers target developers to break into Apple’s garden
"Microsoft is now telling commercial customers that Windows 10 21H1 is ready for ""commercial pre-release validation,"" a phrase it first used in August 2020 prior to the launch of that year's minor fall upgrade.""Windows 10, version 21H1, is now available for commercial customers to begin feature exploration and validation prior to being released for general availability,"" Aria Carley, senior program manager, wrote in a .Microsoft has not yet divulged a launch date for Windows 10 21H1, the year's first feature upgrade, as noted by the  — for first-half — designation. However, a month ago, the Redmond, Wash. developer implied that, unlike in years past, the , one with few if any new features and little new functionality.Carley's post confirmed that.""Version 21H1 will be delivered to devices currently running Windows 10, version 2004 or version 20H2 using an enablement package,"" she said. ""This is the same technology we used to update devices from Windows 10, version 2004 to version 20H2.""The  Carley mentioned was the tip-off, as that small code fragment is what transformed Windows 10 2004 into 20H2 last year. That was possible because 20H2  as 2004 as released and  as 2004 by the time 20H2 was to debut.(Confused? Microsoft built Windows 10 21H1 by taking October's 20H2, collected everything that changed from that point on — those changes had been issued in the monthly updates since October — and added a handful of new features. Voilà: Windows 10 21H1. Microsoft delivers these minor upgrades through the usual Windows Update/WIndows Update for Business/WSUS channels as the monthly cumulative update. The enablement package is essentially a command given to Windows to ""switch on"" the new version, since the code for it is already onboard.)Because Windows 10 21H1 is the second minor upgrade in a row, the enablement package mechanism works on all PCs running Windows 10 20H2  2004. Those enterprise systems running earlier versions of Windows 10 will have to download the entire OS to reach 21H1. (That, too, will be available, either as a  or through WSUS.)This is also the second update running that Microsoft has explicitly told commercial customers to start putting the version through the testing wringer. Last year,  for Windows 10 20H2 exactly two months before it unveiled the so-called upgrade to the public. It appears that Microsoft has decided to add this announcement to the servicing process when it's preparing to issue a minor upgrade.If Microsoft hews to the timetable of 2020 — announcement made two months prior to release — it will launch Windows 10 21H2 in the third week of May, perhaps May 20 or May 21.Ironically, Microsoft's declaration of open testing of Windows 10 21H1 may fail to move corporate IT personnel; the spring update, no matter whether major or minor, comes with only 18 months of support, a year shy of the 30 months awarded by each fall's refresh to the Windows 10 Enterprise and Education SKUs (stock-keeping units). Spring updates are, simply put, second class, and organizations are unlikely to bother deploying 21H1 unless forced to by circumstances, such as owning systems set to exhaust support in the next seven or eight months.With a May launch of Windows 10 21H1 almost certain, the version should receive support until Dec. 13, 2022.",https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/02/one-2-100833948-large.jpg,Microsoft urges enterprise to test Windows 10 21H1 as May launch looms

Those scripts, Wisniewski contended ""behave  enough like the original ones to make sure that the website works properly."" The stand-in scripts thus let the previously-broken sites load properly — blocked scripts sometimes make websites pause or slow rendering — and function as they would if they'd not been touched.These doppelgängers, Wisniewski continued, are bundled with Firefox — they're not loaded from a third-party source, in other words — and, of course, don't behave  like the barred scripts, in that they certainly don't track the user from site to site across the web.SmartBlock will be a multi-edition project for Mozilla, according to Wisniewski. Firefox 87, he said, includes stand-ins for ""a number of common scripts classified as trackers on the Disconnect Tracking Protection List,"" referring to the source Mozilla uses to identify trackers. Those in version 87 ""are just the start"" with more to be provided ""in upcoming versions of Firefox,"" Wisniewski concluded.The new feature is enabled when the user enters Firefox's Private Browsing mode and when Enhanced Tracking Protection is set to ""Strict.""Also new to Firefox 87, Mozilla switched to a default policy that strips out potential tracking information from the , the location at which the browser was just prior to the current site or page.Absent instructions, a browser will typically tell the destination server where it was last at, in essence where it came from.

"Spending on social and collaborative applications will likely see double-digit growth this year, according to a , as businesses focus on keeping remote workers connected during the pandemic and beyond.While videoconferencing tools such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Cisco Webex were the big winners of the global shift to remote working during 2020, there has also been an uptick in interest in other types of platforms that connect workers and facilitate ad-hoc communications and “watercooler”-style interactions.Revenues in three software market segments – collaborative work management, enterprise social networks. and employee communication software – are set to reach almost $4.5 billion in 2021, a 17% increase from $3.8 billion in 2020, according to Gartner’s “Forecast Analysis: Social and Collaboration Software in the Workplace, Worldwide.”  The five-year revenue forecast predicts that revenues will increase by double-digit percentages each year to $6.9 billion in 2024; the research firm increased its long-term revenue growth forecast in comparison to its 2019 expectations due to the global shift toward remote work. Other drivers behind the increase include a rise in the number of knowledge workers globally, according to Gartner.“The need to suddenly empty out all the office buildings, while keeping businesses afloat, gave a jolt to many markets, with social and collaboration being one of those at the forefront,” said Craig Roth, research vice president at Gartner and one of the report’s authors. “Social and collaboration products went from ‘nice to have’ to ‘must have’ within a period of a few weeks.”Of the three areas covered in the report, collaborative work management tools – including the likes of ,  and Monday – were the biggest driver of revenue growth, as businesses sought to digitize “non-routine” task management and coordination processes that would otherwise require back-and-forth emails. “Tracking and coordination of work outside of formal project plans became a lot more difficult when you couldn't just ask for status over a cube wall. These tools, which were on an upswing anyway, got an extra boost [during the pandemic],” said Roth.The report also forecasts that collaborative and social functionality will increasingly be embedded into CRM, HR and ERP business applications. Gartner predicts that 65% of enterprise application software provides will include collaboration features in their products by 2025.That trend is well under way. Microsoft recently announced that its Teams collaboration tool will be , for example, while Salesforce’s  is likely to bring tight integration across its suite of business apps.The advantage of embedding social and collaboration functionality is the ability to include non-formalized processes, such as conversations or content sharing, in more process-oriented business tools.  “Going forward, we’ll start seeing [collaboration] products integrated more into packaged business applications, as opposed to being a siloed product on the side that, every now and then, you exit your business application to do some collaboration, and then go back to ‘work,’” said Roth. “It shouldn't feel that way.”",https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/fintech_electronic_payments_banking_dollars_euros_pounds_yen_by_metamorworks_gettyimages-1127063674_2400x1600-100835370-large.jpg,Gartner: Spending on social and collaboration software booms as remote work takes hold
"Slack moved quickly this week to make changes to its public direct messaging feature after a backlash highlighted the potential for harassment from people sending abusive messages.The Slack Connect DM feature, , became generally available to all users of the platform on Wednesday. It enables Slack users to send an invite to someone outside of their Slack “workspace,” which, when accepted by the other party, allows direct messages to be exchanged in the chat app.The invite is sent to the recipient’s email address with a button to “accept” the invitation.

Admins can also restrict the sending of DM invitations to “verified organizations” only.A Slack spokesperson said that as while it is not currently possible to block individuals, the company continues to explore new ways to “empower our users and give our admins more granular tools to take action on harassment or otherwise unacceptable behavior.“That being said, if harassment is occurring on our platform and your employer is unable to intervene, we encourage you to contact us via Slack’s Help Center to report your concerns and we will investigate and take appropriate action,” the spokesperson said.“The ability for Slack users on a paid plan to direct message others extends the abilities and the possibilities in streamlining the flow of work,” said Wayne Kurtzman, a research director at IDC. “It could still be transformative with a proper launch.”The launch of the feature on Wednesday was “uncharacteristic” for Slack, said Kurtzman, and — with the company awaiting regulatory clearance for its $27.7 billion acquisition by Salesforce — could have been hampered by limitations of a company being in a pre-acquisition mode.“The user base has been waiting on this feature for some time, and perhaps Slack got the reaction it needed to properly roll this feature out with the privacy elements that people expect,” he said.",https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/slack_network_security_by_your_photo_gettyimages-1093539466_2400x1600-100836960-large.jpg,Slack blocks public DM ‘invite messages’ after backlash

"Not long ago, a low-profile program called Android One looked like it could be just the one-two punch Android needed.Android One, like lots of Google initiatives, has had a long and winding history with plenty of twists and turns. When Android One first came into the picture in 2014, it was described as an effort to ""make high-quality smartphones accessible to as many people as possible."" The focus was squarely on bringing affordable phones with exceptional experiences to emerging markets — places like Pakistan and India, where it could be ""hard for people"" to ""get their hands on a high-quality smartphone,"" as Google  at the time.But that was just the start of Google's Android One ambitions. Three years later, in 2017, Google  with the launch of Android One phones in places like Japan, Taiwan, and eventually the United States. The company changed its description of the effort from that original small-scale focus to the much broader vision of a ""collaboration between Google and [its] partners to deliver a software experience ,"" with a guarantee of reasonably timely ongoing operating system updates and an experience that'd be free from all the  and  baked into .Sound familiar? It should. It's basically the  we see with Google's own self-made Pixel phones, only scaled down a bit and with other manufacturers involved. Or, to zoom back even further into Android nerdland, it's incredibly similar to what we to see with  many moons ago — where Google would bring in other phone-makers to handle the hardware but then maintain complete control over the software, support, and overall user experience itself. (In the Nexus scenario, of course, the phones were branded as Google devices. But that surface-level distinction aside, the situation is almost eerily comparable.)Over the last few years, Android One has grown more and more mature, with a lineup of impressively decent budget-level and even midrange devices made by the likes of Nokia, LG, Motorola, and a handful of other companies. Those phones have consistently been ahead of the pack when it comes to the  of , with post-sales support that puts most other options — including those that cost four to five times as much — to shame.Lately, though, something strange has been happening. The once-thriving Android One program seems to have quietly faded into an almost forgotten footnote. The pace of new devices showing up in the program's virtual shelves has slowed down to a trickle, and the phones that  still alive and kickin' within the Android One walls are failing to meet their one-time promises of fast and frequent software updates.So what in the world is happening? I'm a curious creature, and I found myself scratching my wooly man-noggin to little result (aside from itch satiation) trying to figure it out. So I decided to dig a little deeper to see what I could find. And, well...Let's start with the first front — the dearth of recent Android One devices and the apparent lack of attention Google is devoting to the program (a program for which it had previously promised to provide ""major promotional dollars,"" according to a ).All you've gotta do is look at Google's official  to see the unavoidable signs that  unusual is afoot. Right under the top-of-page headline promising phones that are ""secure, up-to-date, and easy to use"" is a graphic showing the Nokia 5.3 — a phone that was announced an , last March, and is still running 2019's Android 10 software, nearly seven months after Android 11's release. Yeaaaaaaaaah. I'm no mathematician, but something sure doesn't seem to add up.And the disconnect only gets even more blatant from there: That primary front-and-center graphic with the Nokia 5.3 actually describes the phone as having ""the latest Android 10 operating system"" — despite the fact that Android 10 hasn't been ""the latest""  since last September. Um, right.The other ""latest phones"" featured on the page aren't any better. One of the top devices shown on the Android One landing page, the Motorola One Action, came out at the end of October — in . It also has yet to receive the now-seven-month-old Android 11 update, despite being part of the Android One program.Motorola, for its part, seems to have mostly just moved on from its Android One focus. Confusingly, it's continued to release devices with that One branding as part of their titles — like last year's  and  — but it's seemingly reclaimed that branding as its own, without any of the Android One associations or promises.So what about Nokia — the company that  with Android One and that I once labeled as the """"? I reached out to that company's media relations department multiple times over the past week to ask for an explanation on both  to provide timely updates to its current crop of Android One phones and its sudden slowdown in new Android One device releases, and I've yet to receive any response.What we  say is that first, Nokia's had some public struggles over the past months — with reports  that the company could be ""exploring strategic options,"" including a possible sale or merger. (Those reports were later , but the fact that such talk is even out there is never a great sign.) Just this past Friday, the company's chief product officer and one of its most prominent public figures  — which may or may not have any direct connection to whatever's going on with all of this, but again, doesn't help with the perception of an organization that's adrift.As for Google, I asked the company if there was anything it could share about whether Android One was still considered an active effort — and if so, what exactly was going on with (a) the considerable slowdown in new phones coming out within the Android One umbrella and (b) the apparent failure by practically existing Android One device-maker to meet its timely software update promise in this latest upgrade cycle. In response, a company spokesperson sent me the following statement:I pressed a bit further and asked if there was anything more specific that could be said to explain the situation with all of the still-pending Android One software updates, some seven months after Android 11's release, as well as with the recent lull in new Android-One-associated device releases — but I haven't received any additional responses.There is, of course, one perfectly logical possible explanation to all of this — a narrative that ties all the pieces together and certainly  like a sensible answer to why Android One has gone from front and center to faded and forgotten. Rev up that beautiful mammal brain of yours: It's time to explore an all-too-plausible-seeming theory.Stay with me for a sec, 'cause there's some important context we need to think through to set the stage for this sudsy soap-opera drama. Back when Android One first expanded from its initial ""emerging market"" focus, y'see, my favorite writer in the world — an extraordinarily handsome and humble fella — made some astute observations about how the program could be the brilliantly conceived missing piece to Google's grand Android puzzle.Go, go, :Google already provided that same possibility with its own self-made Pixel phone, of course — but at the time, Google was selling only a single high-end (and high-priced, for that era) Pixel model. That meant the majority of phone buyers were never gonna get the Android experience Google clearly saw as being optimal — one that's cohesive and easy to use, that puts complementary Google services front and center, and that remains fresh and compelling for an extended period of time by way of reliable updates.And that's where Android One came into play: By offering a ""Pixel lite"" sort of experience at an affordable price, Google could bring  vision for how  wanted Android to appear to a much larger base of people — despite the fact that it wasn't ready to make its own lower-priced Pixel model at that point.To quote my favorite humble writer once more:So what's changed since then? Ding, ding, ding! You got it: Google started making affordable Android phone with its ideal software setup and self-controlled, super-speedy software updates. That's precisely what the  is all about, and with a price of 350 bucks, it brings the same optimized experience we first saw in the high-end Pixel into a much more affordable form. It  the ""Pixel lite,"" without any of the asterisks Android One involves in comparison.With Google selling its own completely self-controlled Pixel phone for 350 smackeroos, then, what reason does it have left to really, truly care about Android One in the way it once did? The entire reason Android One originally benefitted Google is made mostly redundant and unnecessary by the Pixel ""a"" line's existence. For the most part, an Android One phone is a watered-down, lesser version of a Pixel ""a"" device, and it's typically sold for pretty darn close to the same price (sometimes even more).When you combine that fact with the shifting Android landscape — what we talked about a minute ago with Nokia combined with LG's , one-time Android One partner HTC's increased irrelevance, and the lack of any real motivation for an already-successful-on-its-own phone-maker like Samsung to participate in this sort of effort — it kinda makes sense that Android One would start to fizzle, doesn't it?I mean, think about: The program's most prominent players are all having their own issues, and Google simultaneously now has its own fully self-controlled product to serve the program's original purpose even more effectively. It also has the ultra-low-end-focused  to address the super-affordable, sub-$200 domain that the Pixel line doesn't (yet) cover. Really, it's no wonder the Android One promise and everything around it seem mostly out of mind.And you know what? This is admittedly reading between the lines, but if you look back at Google's statement on the subject, it seems almost deliberately worded to avoid saying anything substantial about the program's long-term fate. Yes, it says that Android One is a ""living program that continues to grow"" — but look closely at that last line (the emphasis here being mine):Nothing to announce about the program's future ? That sure isn't the same as saying ""This program isn't going anywhere, bucko!"" And continuing to work with partners to bring great Android devices to market? Note the lack of a mention of Android One, specifically, as part of that proposition.When I wrote about Android One's potential back in 2017, I noted how the effort could fill the then-glaring void of an optimal Google experience within Android at the sub-flagship price range. As I said at the time:Well, guess what? Here we are, four years later — and Google has taken that ambitious leap into the affordable Android phone market. It  invested the resources in developing its own devices at lower price points, and by most counts, the first Pixel ""a""-line phones have , relatively speaking.Google may not be ready to pull the plug on Android One yet, but looking at all the variables surrounding the state of the program, it's hard not to wonder if the clock is already ticking — and, in one way or another, if it's just a matter of time until the seconds run out.",https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/android-one-google-100882613-large.jpg,What the hell is happening with Android One?
"Apple has : WWDC 2021 will be an all-online event once again — a tacit acknowledgement of  the  last year.WWDC 2021 will run between June 7-11, be free to developers, and will “build on the record-breaking participation and learnings from last year’s online conference,” the company said in a statement.The event is open to Apple’s global community of 28 million developers. The show will feature the annual keynote and State of the Union announcements, online sessions, and 1:1 labs for technical guidance. Intriguingly, Apple also promises: “New ways for developers to interact with Apple engineers and designers to learn about the latest frameworks and technologies.“We love bringing our developers together each year at WWDC to learn about our latest technologies and to connect them with Apple engineers,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations and Enterprise and Education Marketing. “We are working to make WWDC21 our biggest and best yet, and are excited to offer Apple developers new tools to support them as they create apps that change the way we live, work, and play.” The company plans to share more information pertaining to the giant developer event later, via the , on the, and by email.It was inevitable, really. COVID-19 continues to blight lives and one year later we know more about the threat it represents. Not only does the disease mutate, but  is neither complete, nor fully international.This is true to such an extent that it makes no sense to combine an international collection of Apple’s most important supporters, partners, and followers in a public space. I think we’ll see the potential damage of such mixing at MWC 2021, which still  to take place.The decision also matches Apple’s outlook.

The company has also pushed hard to play its part in the struggle against the pandemic — it has invested way too much cash and energy in this to undermine that good work with a premature attempt at returning to normal.The company certainly won’t want to squeeze thousands of its most important personnel, staff, and partners into long-distance flights, exposing all parties to risk.These considerations will have formed part of the company’s thinking on the matter. The fact that it achieved such a successful event in 2020 shows that it is possible to yield a good outcome from a bad situation. It may, however, prove interesting to find out just what Apple has developed in terms of new virtual experiences for collaboration during the event.Apple is once again giving students who code a chance to take part in the  This year’s challenge has an interactive edge. It is to create an interactive scene in Swift Playground that can be experienced inside three minutes. Students have until April 18 to submit their work and winners will receive exclusive WWDC21 outerwear and a pin set.With thousands of visitors every year, WWDC usually brings a lot of money to local businesses in San Jose and beyond. In a gesture of solidarity, Apple is contributing $1 million to SJ Aspires, an education and equity initiative from the City of San Jose. The scheme aims to enable youth from underserved neighbourhoods to access a college education.There are probable, possible, and potential announcements likely at WWDC.Primarily, Apple will discuss its platforms and software, which will be evidenced in first glances st new iterations of its operating systems. Those are the probables.Apple’s big hint of possible — new interactive tools — suggests much more exploration around platforms and solutions for collaboration in virtual space. That’s not an especially new focus for the AR-invested company, but does show how much more relevant to daily lives such technology is becoming.Apple will almost certainly want to discuss the Apple , which makes some form of Mac announcement possible.All of these possibles also open the door to potential news, almost certainly around AR development — though all  suggests introduction of v.1 Apple AR glasses won’t take place until 2022.Perhaps Apple has some  up its sleeve?",https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/06/memoji-wwdc20-100850262-large.jpg,Apple confirms WWDC 2021 will be an online event
"Microsoft has begun rolling out its Windows release health dashboard to the Microsoft 365 admin portal, a move the company previewed earlier this month at its all-virtual Ignite conference.""This will be a phased rollout and we expect this information experience to be available to all applicable customers by the end of April,"" Mabel Gomes, senior communications program manager in the Windows group, said in a .The original Windows release health launched almost two years ago as one of the changes Microsoft instituted after the disastrous debut of Windows 10 1809, the fall 2018 version of the operating system that had to be yanked from release because it deleted data.That dashboard — later labeled a ""hub"" — has offered information on current rollout status and known issues, both open and closed cases, for all Windows 10 updates. Notably, the hub was the one public location where Microsoft posted information about all Windows 10 , issues that have prevented machines from upgrading to the next refresh (and thus marked the systems Microsoft would refuse to offer an update).The public release health hub .The Windows release health being added to the Microsoft 365 admin center will be similar but not identical to the existing hub; essentially, it will be ""public hub-plus.""""Because the admin center is specifically designed for IT admins, you will find greater technical detail about known issues, earlier reminders about important milestones like end of service, and more resources to help you plan for and deploy Windows updates,"" Gomes wrote about the release health add-in. ""Our goal is to help you diagnose issues in your environment fast, provide steps to mitigate them quickly, and provide a root cause analysis for better support.""To access Windows release health in the admin portal, customers must be subscribers to Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3/A3/F3, Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5/A5, Windows 10 Enterprise E3/A3 or Windows 10 Enterprise E5/A5.Interestingly, Microsoft denied that release health ""monitor[s] user environments or collect customer environment information,"" to, for example, post blocker information specific to the OS version(s) being run by an organization. In the next breath, though, Microsoft acknowledged that ""future iterations of [release health] may target content based on customer location, industry, or Windows version.""The latter would seem to be a selling point for release health in the admin center, since it would only display information that  affected the firm's own Windows 10 PCs. Most likely, if or when Microsoft  focus release health on the on-premises devices, it will use the telemetry collected by the operating system to do so, the same telemetry utilized by Desktop Analytics (née Windows Analytics).A more detailed explanation of what the admin center's release health component offers can be found on .
